========
SELock
========

The SELock is a shared/exclusive lock that you can use to safely read
from and write to resources in a multi-threaded application.

The SELock does not actually protect resources directly. Instead, the
SELock provide coordination by blocking threads when they request a lock
that is currently owned by another thread. That means the application
must ensure it appropriately requests the lock before attempting to read
from or write to a resource.

The application must first instatiate an SELock object that can be
accessed by the threads in the application. When a thread wants to read
from a resource it requests the lock for shared mode. If the lock is
currently not held or is currently held by other threads that in
shared mode, and no threads are waiting for the lock for exclusive mode,
the new request is granted immediately. For all other cases, the request
is queued and blocked until the lock become available.

When a thread wants to write to a resource it requests the lock
in exclusive mode. If the lock is currently not held, the new request is
granted immediately. For all other cases, the request is queued and
blocked until the lock become available.

The application can instantiate a single lock to protect any number of
resources, or several locks for more granularity where each lock can
protect a single resource. The application design will need to consider
performance (more granularity may perform better) and
reliability (more granularity may lead to deadlock situtations).

The SELock provide two ways to use the lock:
    1) methods obtain_excl, obtain_share, and release
    2) context managers SELockExcl, SELockShare, and SELockObtain


:Example: use methods obtain_excl, obtain_share, and release to
          coordinate access to a shared resource

>>> from scottbrian_locking.se_lock import SELock
>>> a_lock = SELock()
>>> # Get lock in exclusive mode
>>> a_lock.obtain_excl()
>>> print('lock obtained in exclusive mode')
lock obtained in exclusive mode

>>> # release the lock
>>> a_lock.release()

>>> # Get lock in shared mode
>>> a_lock.obtain_share()
>>> print('lock obtained in shared mode')
lock obtained in shared mode

>>> # release the lock
>>> a_lock.release()


:Example: use SELockExcl and SELockShare context managers to coordinate
          access to a shared resource

>>> from scottbrian_locking.se_lock import (SELock, SELockExcl,
...                                         SELockShare)
>>> a_lock = SELock()
>>> # Get lock in exclusive mode
>>> with SELockExcl(a_lock):  # write access
...     msg = 'lock obtained exclusive'
>>> print(msg)
lock obtained exclusive

>>> # Get lock in shared mode
>>> with SELockShare(a_lock):  # read access
...     msg = 'lock obtained shared'
>>> print(msg)
lock obtained shared


:Example: use SELockObtain context managers to coordinate
          access to a shared resource

>>> from scottbrian_locking.se_lock import (SELock, SELockObtain,
...                                         SELockObtainMode)
>>> a_lock = SELock()
>>> # Get lock in exclusive mode
>>> with SELockObtain(a_lock, SELockObtainMode.Exclusive):  # write
...     msg = 'lock obtained exclusive'
>>> print(msg)
lock obtained exclusive

>>> # Get lock in shared mode
>>> with SELockObtain(a_lock, SELockObtainMode.Share):  # read
...     msg = 'lock obtained shared'
>>> print(msg)
