=====How to use mkdocs=====

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you've met the following requirements:
* You have installed the latest version of `<Python>`.
* You have a `<Windows / Linux / Mac>` machine.
* You read the [project GitPage](https://fga-eps-mds.github.io/2022-2-Squad07/index.html).


## Installation

To install *ez-docs*, open an interactive shell and run:
```bash
$ python<version> -m pip install ez-docs
```

## Using ez-docs

To start using *ez-docs*, you'll need a markdown template, a database (.csv, .txt, xls) and a pattern of keys.

* directory_template: str - template folder .md
* key_name_file: str - parameter concerning the denominator key of the document name, which must follow the format {key_name}.
For example, for a template that has the keys "name" and "registration", the output could be "name_registration", generating the following results:
    - Aaron_3141592653.pdf
    - Barnardo_2718281828.pdf
    - Caliban_4815162342.pdf

    Valid separators: registration_name, registration-name, registration:name, registration name.
* key_value: dict - dictionary with all the keys and their respective values, already extracted from the module that handled
	the data.
    - Structure:
    ```python
    {
        "NAME": "Diomedes",
        "CLASS": "Databases",
        "DATE": "23 November 2022",
        "TIN": "161.803.398-87",
        "REGISTRATION": "1123581321"
    }
    ```
    Keys are arbitrary in nature, which means that their names, quantities, and repetitions are uncertain. All will be searched within the template: those found will be replaced by the corresponding value, and those that are not will be indicated in the terminal via warning.
* flag: int - optional parameter that defines the final output format.
    - 1 (def.) - The doc will be converted to .pdf
    - 2 - The doc will remain in .md

With that, you may open an interactive shell and run:
```bash
$ ez-docs <~/template.md> <~/database> <~/pattern_keys> --flag = 1 or 2
```
