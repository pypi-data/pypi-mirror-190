InnoDB Optimize
===============

|Pypi| |MIT licensed| |GitHub Release Date|

``innodb-optimize`` is a package for automatically calucalating
optimized InnoDB configurations, and generating an updated ``my.cnf``
file with those values.

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

   # PyPi Installation
   pip install innodb-optimize
   # GitHub Installation
   pip install git+'https://github.com/Scraps23/innodb_optimize.git'

Usage
-----

Basic Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following command will output the generated configuration to
``STDOUT``. This is useful when using this tool in other scripts, such
as automating system deployments.

.. code:: bash

   innodb-optimize

Standard Commit Loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| The ``--commit`` flag should be included for an interactive run. The
  user is first asked whether the configuration should be saved; there
  is an option to print the generated config to console.
| If the configuration is read, the user is prompted for the same
  question.
| If the configuration is saved, the user is prompted to restart MySQL;
  there is an option to schedule the restart using bash’s ``at``
  program.

.. code:: bash

   innodb-optimize --commit

   :alt: Standard Loop

   Standard Loop

Available Arguments
-------------------

-  ``file``: Where the MySQL configuration file is located. Defaults to
   ``/etc/mysql/my.cnf``.
-  ``percent``: Determines what percentage of the total memory will be
   devoted to InnoDB engine usage. Defaults to 75%.
-  ``memory``: Allows the user to override the total memory amount
   (i.e. a fixed amount is already pre-allocated which is not easily
   accounted for in percentages). Only allows for kilobyte unit.
-  ``commit``: Is required to start the loop which will commit the
   changes. Without it, the program only outputs the config to standard
   out to allow for piping/redirecting the output as needed.
