Sympl: A System for Modelling Planets
=====================================

**sympl** is an open source project aims to enable researchers and other
users to write understandable, modular, accessible Earth system and planetary
models in Python. It is meant to be used in combination with other packages
that provide model components in order to write model scripts. Its source
code can be found on GitHub_.

New users should read the :ref:`quickstart`. This framework is meant to be used along
with model toolkits like CliMT_ to write models. See the paper_ on Sympl and
CliMT for a good overview and some examples! You may also want to check out the
`CliMT documentation`_.
