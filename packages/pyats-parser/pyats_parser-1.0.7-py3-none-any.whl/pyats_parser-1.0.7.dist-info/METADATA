c# pyats_parser
This library is a workaround to use PyATS parser libraries outside PyATS workflow which consist of declaring devices in a testbed and connect to device with pyATS, execute command with pyATS and finally parse output.

With pyats_parser you just have to fill the cli return collected by NSO live status, netmiko , etc... 

# Installation

```
pip install pyats-parser
```
# Usage
```python
from pyats_parser import parser

show_version = """
RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:MY-DEVICE#show version

result = parser.parse(show_version,"show version","iosxr")
```

And you will get the structured output as a dictionary :
```python
{'operating_system': 'IOSXR', 
 'software_version': '7.1.15', 
 'device_family': 'ASR9K',
 'uptime': '1 year 6 weeks 5 days 18 hours 42 minutes'}
```
