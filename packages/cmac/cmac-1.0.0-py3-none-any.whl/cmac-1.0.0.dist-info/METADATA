# Rapid Protoyping of Macarna
- Don't believe everything you see/read folks.
- This shouldn't have even been a package...
- A package should do more than just one function
- I challenge the author to write a suite of cyber tools for MAC addresses

## Who is this for?
- The people that develop our software, deploy our architectures, and monitor our networks
- Mainly for people whose first languages are not human, but instead, computer-based
- Who doesn't speak a human language??? Dumbledore's Army!!!

## Usage
``` python
>>> from cmac import MacLookup
>>> mac_table = MacLookup()
>>> mac_table.lookup("00:03:DA:FF:FD:DE")
```
