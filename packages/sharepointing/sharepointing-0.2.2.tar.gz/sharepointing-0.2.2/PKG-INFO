# Sharepointing
A library to establish connection to sharepoint. Then operate on this connection. Right now it's only possible to upload files.

This library depends on office 365 library: `Office365-REST-Python-Client`, and it will use active directory authentication to connect to SharePoint.

## Installation
In order to install this library you need to obtain an `SSH code`

Use pip to install this library from Github:

    pip install sharepointing

## Requirements
First you need to initialize the the sharepoint connection, which is an object.
You have two options, either use embedded credentials in environment variables:

`USERNAME` for office365 email

`PASSWORD` for office365 password


Then you can use this call:

    sp = sharepointing.sp_site(site_url)

The second option is to provide the credentials in the class call:

    sp = sharepointing.sp_site(site_url,username,password)

Once the object is created successfully, you can call use `upload_file` method to upload the files to sharepoiont

## decode_link function
This function will take any full link from SharePoint and can give back two two options
1 > The site_url
2 > The target folder
3 > Both as list
Instructions: Using your browser, open your SharePoint site and navigate to the target folder
Copy the link from the browser, and provide it here.

## Example 1 - upload_file
    site_url = "https://companysite.sharepoint.com/teams/teamsname"
    target = "/teams/teamsname/Shared Documents/General/"
    file = 'file.txt'
    sp = sharepointing.sp_site(site_url)
    sp.upload_file(file,target)

## Example 2 - decode_link
    full_link = "https://companysite.sharepoint.com/teams/teamsname/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fteams%teamsname%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FSales%20Management%2F99%2E%20Resources%2F02%2E%20First%20Region&viewid=ecdf0311%2De700%2D4d9b%2Db7d3%2D6eaecaf18c76"
    site_url = decode_link(full_link,1)
    target = decode_link(full_link,2)

## Example 3 - download_file
    # Get the target url of where file is
    sp_url = "https://excellentproject.sharepoint.com/teams/MarketingTeam/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fteams%2FMarketingTeam%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FMarketing%20Reports%2Fdata&viewid=ecdf0311dddd9dbddd7d3%2Dddddddsad"

    # Extract the site url and the target folder
    site_url,target_folder = decode_link(sp_url,3)

    # Define the file name 'myfile.csv' and construct its full path
    remote_file = os.path.join(target_folder,'myfile.csv')

    # Local folder path, can be referring to anything
    local_folder = ""

    # Initialize the SharePoint site object
    sp = sp_site(site_url)

    # Execute the recieve
    sp.download_file(remote_file,local_folder)
