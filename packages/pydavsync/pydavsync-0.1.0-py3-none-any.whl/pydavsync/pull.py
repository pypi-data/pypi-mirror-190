    Warning:
        At the moment, sync is only done based on names. An improvement is to take
        other parameters into acccount like hash or size.

    Args:
        webdav_client: (webdav4.client.Client) the webdav connection to use for sync.
        remote_path: (str|pathlib.Path) The remote path to sync. Can be a directory
            or a file.
        local_path: (str|pathlib.Path) The local path where to sync the remote_path.
            It does not necessarily exist as the tree leaf can be created.
        recursive: (bool) Whether to sync subdirectories as well.
        ignore: (regex str) a pattern to ignore some paths (matches the full path).
        keep_tree: (bool) If True, the whole directory path given in `remote_path`
            is created in `local_directory`. If False, only the leaf is
            synchronized. Default is False.
            Example:
                if `remote_path` is `/dir1/dir2/dir3/file`
                When keep_tree=True, the file is written on this local path:
                `<local_directory>/dir1/dir2/dir3/file`
                When keep_tree=False, the file is written on this local path:
                `<local_directory>/file`
        delete: (bool) (optional) If True, delete local files that are not on the
            remote filesystem. Default is False, nothing is deleted.
        dry: (bool) (optional) If True, do not actually download the files, but only
            display a list of actions that would be performed. Default is False.
        verbose: (bool) (optional) If True, display details. Default is False.

    Raises:
        NotADirectoryError if `local_directory` is not a local directory.
        FileNotFoundError if the `remote_path` points to nothing.
