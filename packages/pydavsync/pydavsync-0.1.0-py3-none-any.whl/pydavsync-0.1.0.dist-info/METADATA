# pydavsync

A command line to synchronize files with WebDav servers, written in Python.

## Name

The foundational idea was to have a similar command line and behavior to
[rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/), but for WebDav servers. `davsync` is the logical
name. But I started to implement it in Rust, then in Python, and I decided to integrate
the development language in the name. Thus `pydavsync` for the Python implementation.

## Description

[rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) allows to synchronize files over a SSH connection.
[pydavsync](https://framagit.org/RomainTT/pydavsync/) has been developed to do the same
over a WebDav connection.

The command line is not identical because compatibility is not a goal, and some new
ideas emerged while developing `pydavsync`.

The following operations can be doneÂ :
- Synchronization from local filesystem to WebDav server
- Synchronization from WebDav server to local filesystem
- Synchronization from WebDav server to WebDav server (not necessarily the same)

Here are some of the featuresÂ :
- dry run
- verbose output
- login/password given through command line options
- synchronization based on modified time and file size
- deletion when files disappear

### Webdav?

[Webdav](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV) is used to manage files on remote servers
using HTTP.

The primary motivation was to use `pydavsync` with [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)
which is compatible with webdav. But there are many other services accepting webdav.

## Installation

`pydavsync` is available on [Pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/pydavsync) and can be
installed using `pip`. Many options are available to you, do as you please.

```
pip install pydavsync
```

## Usage

Once installed, the program `pydavsync` should be available in your terminal.

To get help, use `pydavsyncc --help`.

Here is an example to synchronize files from a webdav server to a local directory.

```sh
$ pydavsync --src-user Username --src-pass Password --verbose https://my-server.org/path/to/my/directory /path/to/local/directory
```

## Support

If you have a question or need help, please [open an issue](https://framagit.org/RomainTT/pydavsync/-/issues/new) and tag it with the ~support label.

## Roadmap

Future developments:

- Synchronization from local to webdav (and consequently from webdav to webdav)
- Smarter synchronization if source and destination are both the same webdav server.
- Better tests with mocks to simulate a webdav server.
- A [man](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html) page.
- New and optional means to check if a file has changed or not.

## Contributing

- Firstly, you can open [a new issue](https://framagit.org/RomainTT/pydavsync/-/issues/new) if you find a bug or have an improvement idea.
- Any help to test the tool on various systems and Webdav servers is appreciated, as I did not checked many of these myself.
- If you feel like coding, please [fork](https://framagit.org/RomainTT/pydavsync/-/forks/new) the repository and do a [merge request](https://framagit.org/RomainTT/pydavsync/-/merge_requests). It will be reviewed. Donâ€™t forget to mention issues in your comments if you fix some of them!
