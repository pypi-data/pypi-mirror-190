# ACwater Polymer

Atmospheric correction of EnMAP hyperspectral data for water surfaces

**ACwater Polymer** implements a class to load an EnMAP object and
execute atmospheric correction for water surfaces. ACwater Polymer
requires *EnPT* for the EnMAP data processing and *Polymer* for the
atmospheric correction algorithm.

**Operating system** for installation is **linux**, tested on Debian
GNU/Linux 9.9 (stretch) - Linux 4.9.0-9-amd64 x86_64.

**Requirements** are
[EnPT](https://gitext.gfz-potsdam.de/EnMAP/GFZ_Tools_EnMAP_BOX/EnPT) and
[polymer](https://www.hygeos.com/polymer).

**Installation** of EnPT follows
[EnPT instructions](https://enmap.git-pages.gfz-potsdam.de/GFZ_Tools_EnMAP_BOX/EnPT/doc/installation.html).

## Installation

[Instructions](https://gitlab.awi.de/phytooptics/acwater/-/blob/master/docs/installation.rst)
 basically include cloning and installing the package and its dependencies using a python package manager.
However, ACwater Polymer and Polymer must be installed with EnPT in the same environment.

## Features

-   Level 1 class for connecting EnPT and Polymer.
-   Integration with database of simulated water spectra.
