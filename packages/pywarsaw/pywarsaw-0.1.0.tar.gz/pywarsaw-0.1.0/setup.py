For example, you can obtain a list of objects with information about current air quality in Warsaw, with caching enabled like this:\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport pywarsaw\n\nasync def main():\n    client = pywarsaw.Mermaid(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")\n    await client.cache_enable()\n\n    result = await client.get_air_quality()\n    \n    await client.close()\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\nOr with the context manager:\n```python\nasync with pywarsaw.Mermaid(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY") as client:\n    await client.cache_enable()\n    \n    result = await client.get_air_quality()\n```\nCaching can be disabled with:\n```python\nawait client.cache_disable()\n```\nEvery object from the obtained list an be converted to the simpler structures:\n```python\n# convert object to the dictionary\nresult_dict = result[0].to_dict()\n\n# convert object to the tuple\nresult_tuple = result[0].to_tuple()\n\n# convert object to the flat dict - useful for creating Pandas dataframes\nresult_flat = result[0].to_flat_dict()\n\n# convert object to the json string\nresult_json = result[0].to_json()\n```\n\n## Currently covered\nWarsaw Open Data has a lot of different endpoints and data categories to cover.\n\nThe current status of work is:\n\n**Culture**\n* culture (vector maps):\n    * theathers :heavy_check_mark:\n\n**Public transport**\n* ZTM timetables:\n    * stops :heavy_check_mark:\n    * lines :heavy_check_mark:\n    * timetables :heavy_check_mark:\n* transport (vector maps):\n    * cycle stations :heavy_check_mark:\n    * cycle tracks :heavy_check_mark:\n    * parking lots :heavy_check_mark:\n    * subway entrances :heavy_check_mark:\n* stops information:\n    * coordinates :heavy_check_mark:\n    * current day coordinates :heavy_check_mark:\n\n**Education**\n* computers and internet access:\n    * internet access :heavy_check_mark:\n    * computers purpose :heavy_check_mark:\n* statics about schools :x:\n* education - rooms :x:\n* schools :x:\n\n**Ecology**\n* shrubs:\n    * shrubs :heavy_check_mark:\n    * groups of shrubs :heavy_check_mark:\n* forests:\n    * forests :heavy_check_mark:\n* trees:\n    * groups of trees :heavy_check_mark:\n    * trees :heavy_check_mark:\n* munincipal waste:\n    * waste segregation :heavy_check_mark:\n* air quality:\n    * air quality :heavy_check_mark:\n\n**Online data**\n* trams and buses:\n    * trams and buses :heavy_check_mark:\n* queuing systems :x:\n* road works :x:\n\n**Spatial data**\n* ATMs :x:\n* names of urban objects :x:\n* health :x:\n* bikes :x:\n* sport :x:\n* accommodation :x:\n\n**Safety**\n* defibrillators:\n    * defibrillators :heavy_check_mark:\n* safety (vector maps) :x:\n\n**Official data**\n* administration (vector maps) :x:\n* 19115 :x:\n* sport :x:\n* events :x:\n\n## Terms of data usage\nTranslated from [here](https://api.um.warszawa.pl/#).\n\nPublic data available on the service are official materials and as such are not protected by copyright law.
