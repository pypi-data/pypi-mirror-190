### About
This python package provides an easy way to create projects and upload samples into Biomage.

## Installation
To install the package execute the following line:

`pip install biomage-programmatic-interface`

## Usage
In order to use the package you first need to create an account in Biomage (https://scp.biomage.net/) if you don't have one yet.

Then the package is used in the following way:

```python
import biomage_programmatic_interface as bpi

# 1. Authenticate user and create a connection tunnel with the api
# Default instance-url: https://api.scp.biomage.net/
connection = bpi.Connection('email', 'password', 'instance_url')

# 2. Create an experiment
experiment = connection.create_experiment('experiment name')

# 3. Upload samples associated with the experiment
experiment.upload_samples('local/path/to/samples')
```

Once the upload is complete you can navigate to [Biomage](https://scp.biomage.net/) and process your project there.

### `Connection` class

The object accepts 3 parameters:
1. `email` - Biomage email
2. `password` - Biomage password
3. `instance_url` - Biomage instance url

- Copy the url of the Biomage instance *excluding* `https://`
- If the url is https://scp.biomage.net/ enter just the domain name: `scp.biomage.net`



## Development

If you cloned the repository and want to try using your local version, do the following:

- Install the local version of the pip package:
```bash
cd programmatic_interface
make install
```

- Now you can import the package and use your local version

```python
import biomage_programmatic_interface as bpi
```

***NOTE***: There is **NO** need to run `make install` every time you make changes to the package. When the local changes have been saved the changes will be automatically reflected.

### Running with local instance of Cellenics

When creating the `connection` object set the `instance_url` to `local`. Now the programmatic interface will use your local api (https://localhost:3000)

```python
import biomage_programmatic_interface as bpi
conn = bpi.Connection(<YOUR EMAIL>, <YOUR PASSWORD>, 'local')
...
```

### Running with staged environment
Set the full path of the instance url (e.g. `https://api-{ENVIRONMENT NAME}.scp-staging.biomage.net/`) 

```python
import biomage_programmatic_interface as bpi
conn = bpi.Connection(<YOUR EMAIL>, <YOUR PASSWORD>, 'https://api-{ENVIRONMENT NAME}.scp-staging.biomage.net/')
...
```

*NOTE: the url is that of the api (i.e. `api-`) and not that of the ui*
