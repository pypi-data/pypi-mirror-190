The **yace** Interface Model (``yim``) is defined by plain-text files in YAML
format, these are described

* Yace Interface Model files (YAML Format)
* Entities
* Interface

The interface idl was initially just a collection of YAML-files, globbed for

things to be done:

* Documentation of the interface idl
* Validation of the interface idl
