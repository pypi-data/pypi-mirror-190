Summary: The Unified Parser unifies Indian languages using a common label set and syllable structure. It converts text to a common label set, generates phoneme sequences and improves natural language understanding in Indian languages. The method requires basic language knowledge and can achieve more than 95% accuracy with good lexicons. New Indian language parsers can be easily developed using this unified approach.
