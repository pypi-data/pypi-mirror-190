And it's been unmaintained for 6 years.\n\nI found a few alternatives for that but none of them were both sync\nand async and since I did not wanted to use 2 differents modules for\nthe same goal, I've decided to write this one, with the rule that the\ncode duplication, between the sync and async versions, should be\nsmartly kept to a very very strict minimum.\n\nAnd here we are then.\n\n\n# Documentation\n\nAPI Documentation is available on readthedocs:\n[https://kaioretry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]\n\n\n## TODO List\n\n* Write a decent README\n* Improve documentation display on the RTD\n",
