## Description

[PIPEWIRE](https://pipewire.org/) provides a low-latency, graph based processing engine
on top of audio and video devices that can be used to
support the use cases currently handled by both pulseaudio
and JACK. PipeWire was designed with a powerful security model
that makes interacting with audio and video devices from 
containerized applications easy, with supporting Flatpak
applications being the primary goal. Alongside Wayland and
Flatpak we expect PipeWire to provide a core building block 
for the future of Linux application development.

[pipewire_python](https://pypi.org/project/pipewire_python/) 
controlls `pipewire` via terminal, creating shell commands 
and executing them as required.

üéπ There are two ways to manage the python package:

1. NO_ASYNC: this way works as expected with delay time between 
`pipewire_python` and the rest of your code.

2. ASYNC: [‚ö†Ô∏èNot yet implemented] this way works delegating
the task to record or to play
a song file in background. Works with threads.

3. MULTIPROCESS: [‚ö†Ô∏èNot yet implemented] Works with processes.

##  Install via
```bash

pip3 install pipewire_python # or pip
```

## Tutorial


```python
from pipewire_python.controller import Controller

# PLAYBACK: normal way
audio_controller = Controller()
audio_controller.set_config(rate=384000,
                            channels=2,
                            _format='f64',
                            volume=0.98,
                            quality=4,
                            # Debug
                            verbose=True)
audio_controller.playback(audio_filename='docs/beers.wav')

# RECORD: normal way
audio_controller = Controller(verbose=True)
audio_controller.record(audio_filename='docs/5sec_record.wav',
                        timeout_seconds=5,
                        # Debug
                        verbose=True)

```

### Linking Ports

```python
from pipewire_python import link

inputs = link.list_inputs()
outputs = link.list_outputs()

# Connect the last output to the last input -- during testing it was found that
# Midi channel is normally listed first, so this avoids that.
source = outputs[-1]
sink = inputs[-1]
source.connect(sink)

# Fun Fact! You can connect/disconnect in either order!
sink.disconnect(source) # Tada!

# Default Input/Output links will be made with left-left and right-right
# connections; in other words, a straight stereo connection.
# It's possible to manually cross the lines, however!
source.right.connect(sink.left)
source.left.connect(sink.right)
```
