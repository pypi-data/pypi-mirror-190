It was made with educational purpose, but is being distributed as a package to other programmers.

If you wish to see how you can use the package, continue reading below.


Solving Combines in Ohm's Law using Pytohm:

Solving combines has become very simple with the use of Pytohm, Pytohm presents 2 main functions inside the combined module.

Example:

from pytohm import combined
combined.solve(volt=10, resistance=2)
