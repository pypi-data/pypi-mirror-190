# Catchment generator
Tool for rapid prototyping of a hydraulic model that can be read and edited with SWMM.
The generator was created using feature analysis and surface runoff research from the literature. 
Fuzzy logic controller rules were developed using parameterized categories of soil, slope, 
and permeability. The catchment configuration procedure was simplified by mapping typical 
storage and Manning's coefficients. The use of fuzzy logic rules allows the system to be modified 
to adjust the categories to certain situations. The use of membership functions allows us to increase 
computation accuracy and customize the tool to diverse applications. Following alteration 
of the catchment in the SWMM GUI allows for accurate portrayal of the real condition of the catchment; 
no issues were encountered in altering the *inp file.

## Requirements
* Python 3

## Usage
To run the script, use the following command: 

```python3 pip install -r requirements``` 

```python3 main.py file_path``` where `file_path` is the path to the SWMM model file.

Then enter the catchment area and select the land use and land form categories.


## About
For the construction of the catchment generator, the type of land use was divided according to Table 1, 
the landform according to Table 2. 
The categories were determined on the basis of the data presented by (Dołęga, Rogala, 1973), given below in Table 3.
