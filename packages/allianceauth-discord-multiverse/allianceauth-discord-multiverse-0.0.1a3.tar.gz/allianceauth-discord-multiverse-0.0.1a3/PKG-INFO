# Discord Multiverse

Service module for managing an unlimited number of discord servers from a single auth instance. It can run side by side with the core auth discord service, or completely standalone.

Most of the code is borrowed from Alliance Auth's core Discord Service Module[link] and re-purposed to be guild agnostic.
