What
----

This is a CLI app with crypto related tools and a high level slightly-circom-circuit-inspired crypto module. This is a heavy WIP, many more algorithms can be added, code can/must also be polished.

+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Tool        | Description                                               |
+=============+===========================================================+
||            || Generates a keypair for a chosen network.                |
|| **keys**   || Encrypts the secret with a chosen algorithm combination. |
|| (offered)  || The public key is shown during generation!               |
||            || Can print a QR code or a basic PEM block!                |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|| **primes** || Utility command for getting prime numbers of a certain   |
|| (offered)  || form.                                                    |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|| **crypto** || crypto will offer options for the above,                 |
|| (planned)  || but generalized to plaintext encryption.                 |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

Modules offered
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**crypto** is a "circuit"-like (slightly circom inspired) wrapper for pyca cryptography with pydantic data validation and sensible defaults:

        * Composited: PBDKF2-AESGCM
        * Key Derivation Functions: PBDKF2 
        * Authenticated Encryption: AESGCM
        * Message Digests (Hash): BLAKE2b

=======
History
=======

1.3.0 (2023-02-06)
------------------

* `prime` command.
* Fix all instances of that write-to-file bug.
* Some style formatting.

1.2.1 (2023-02-03)
------------------

* Bugfix on main command because of a file object
* Don't print "No digest created!", we might not plan digest, need to analyze utility first.

1.2.0 (2023-02-02)
------------------

* Users couldn't use 1 passphrase to decrypt entire text file if so encrypted.
* QR format now also prints public key to QR. See Usage.

1.1.0 (2023-02-02)
------------------

* Fix ugly abstractions in tools.keys and replace with something better.

1.0.2 (2023-02-01)
------------------

* Minor config fixups.

1.0.1 (2023-01-30)
------------------

* First release on PyPI.
