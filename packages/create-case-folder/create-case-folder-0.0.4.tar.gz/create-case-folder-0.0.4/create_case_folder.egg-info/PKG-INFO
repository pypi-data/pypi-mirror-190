# create-case-folder

A command line script for creating a parent folder and sub-folders for case management.

## Usage

To use the script, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
create-case-folder --case F01-66 --evidence EV01
```


The `--case` argument is optional and will default to `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_NEWCASE` if not provided. 

The `--evidence` argument is also optional and will default to `EVIDENCE` if not provided.

The script will create the parent folder and sub-folder for evidence, and then create the following sub-folders inside the evidence folder:

- Documents
- Extracts
- Pictures
- Videos
- Reports

If the folders are successfully created, the script will output a success message.

If there's an error, the script will output an error message with the exception.
