# Action Potential features

`ap_features` is package for computing features of action potential traces. This includes chopping, background correction and feature calculations.

Parts of this library is written in `C` and `numba` and is therefore highly performant. This is useful if you want to do feature calculations on a large number of traces.

## Install
Install the package with pip
```
python -m pip install ap_features
```
See [installation instructions](https://computationalphysiology.github.io/ap_features/INSTALL.html) for more options.


## Available features
The list of currently implemented features are as follows
- Action potential duration (APD)
- Corrected action potential duration (cAPD)
- Decay time (Time for the signal amplitude to go from maximum to (1 - a) * 100 % of maximum)
- Time to peak (ttp)
- Upstroke time (time from (1-a)*100 % signal amplitude to peak)
- Beating frequency
- APD up (The duration between first intersections of two APD lines)
- Maximum relative upstroke velocity
- Maximum upstroke velocity
- APD integral (integral of the signals above the APD line)


## Documentation
