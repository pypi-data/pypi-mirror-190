# Installation
```
pip install autograde.py
```


# Module Interface
Run tests written with [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) against a specified module.
Additional options:
* location of tests (if not in the current directory),
* fallback module to run the tests against,
* where to save a CSV of the test results, and
* config file to specify how results are processed

```
usage: grader [-h] [--fallback FALLBACK] [--submission SUBMISSION] [--tests TESTS]
              [--test-pattern TEST_PATTERN] [--output OUTPUT] [--log LOG] [--config CONFIG]
              path

positional arguments:
  path                  Module to grade

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --fallback FALLBACK   Fallback module to grade
  --submission SUBMISSION
                        Submission name to grade.
  --tests TESTS         Path of tests to run. Defaults to ./
  --test-pattern TEST_PATTERN
                        Test name pattern to match. Defaults to "test*.py"
  --output OUTPUT       Output file for report. Defaults to stdout.
  --log LOG             Log file to use. Defaults to stdout.
  --config CONFIG       Config file to use.
```

# Tests Discovery
Tests to run can be located anywhere using a combination of the `--tests` and `--test-pattern` args.
By default, they are searched for under the current directory and match the `test*.py` pattern.
Tests are discovered using the [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) module.

# Running Tests
While tests are running, the script will change to the directory of `path`.
This means that file locations in tests should be relative to the provided `path`.
`--fallback` helps the module determine all tests that should be run.
This is helpful when the code located at `path` is untrusted and may totally fail the test discovery step.

# Config
The grader config can be specified with the `--config` arg. It is a json file that can specify what happens when a certain test runs or when a certain submission is graded. Individual test configs should be under the `"tests"` map and the key should be of the form: `testFunction (test_filename.TestCaseName)`. Inividual submission configs should be under the `"submissions"` map and match the name of the submission. An example format is below:

```json
{
    "tests": {
        "testSimple1 (test_simple.TestSimpleTestCase)": {
            "name": "Simple Test 1",
            "weight": 2
        }
    },
    "names": {
        "submission_name": {
            "name": "custom label here"
        }
    }
}
```
