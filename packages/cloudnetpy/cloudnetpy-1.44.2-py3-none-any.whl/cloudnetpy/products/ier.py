    """Generates Cloudnet ice effective radius product.

    This function calculates ice particle effective radius using the Grieche et al. 2020 method
    which uses Hogan et al. 2006 to estimate ice water content and alpha from Delanoë et al. 2007.
    In this method, effective radius of ice particles is calculated from attenuated-corrected
    radar reflectivity and model temperature. The results are written in a netCDF file.

    Args:
        categorize_file: Categorize file name.
        output_file: Output file name.
        uuid: Set specific UUID for the file.

    Returns:
        UUID of the generated file.

    Examples:
        >>> from cloudnetpy.products import generate_ier
        >>> generate_ier('categorize.nc', 'ier.nc')
