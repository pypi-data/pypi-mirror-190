# PipelineIntegrity library

[In Russian](READMEru.md)

Free, open source PipelineIntegrity library designed to calculate the degree of danger
of pipeline metal loss defects according to the ASME B31G method.

![ASME B31G method](pipeline_integrity/method/asme_b31g/img/fig_1_1.png)

## Installation

```bash
pip install pipeline-integrity
```

## Usage

A pipe under pressure, with a length, diameter and wall thickness from specified material.

```python
from pipeline_integrity.material import Material
from pipeline_integrity.pipe import Pipe

pipe = Pipe(
  440,  # length, inches
  56,  # diameter, inches
  0.63,  # wall thickness, inches
  Material(  # pipe material
    "Steel",
    52000  # SMYS, psi
  ),
  900  # pressure, psi
)
)
```

Metal loss defect with a specified position on the pipe and a specified depth.

```python
defect = pipe.add_metal_loss(
  40,  # the defect starts at a distance of 40 inches from the beginning of the pipe
  4,  # defect length 4 inches
  10,  # along the circumference of the pipe, the defect begins
       # at 10 arc minutes from the top of the pipe
  20,  # the size of the defect along the circumference is 20 arc minutes
  0.039  # defect depth 0.039 inches
)
```

Context for calculating the degree of severity of the defect according to the ASME B31G method

```python
from pipeline_integrity.method.asme_b31g import Context

asme = Context(defect)
```

Defect depth less than 10% wall thickness, no danger.

```python
from pipeline_integrity.method.asme_b31g import State

assert asme.pipe_state() == State.Ok
```

The depth of the defect is more than 80% of the pipe wall thickness, repair or replacement of the pipe is necessary.

```python
defect.depth = 0.6
assert asme.pipe_state() == State.Replace
```

The depth of the defect is 50% of the pipe wall thickness, but the length of the defect
does not exceed its maximum allowable length.
The defect is not dangerous.

```python
defect.depth = 0.31
assert asme.pipe_state() == State.Safe
```

A defect with a length of 20 inches and a depth of 50% of the pipe wall thickness
requires repair at the specified working pressure in the pipe.

```python
defect.length = 20
assert asme.pipe_state() == State.Repair
```

When the operating pressure is reduced to a safe value, the defect does not require repair.

```python
assert pipe.maop == 900
assert round(asme.safe_pressure, 2) == 700.68
pipe.maop = 700
assert asme.pipe_state() == State.Defected
```
