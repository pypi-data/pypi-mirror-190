# Interconnection Innovation e-Xchange (i2x) Open Test Systems 

This repository contains open grid network models and modeling scripts to 
test and compare different factors/measures (e.g., technoeconomic, social, 
equity, and engineering) that examine practices and policies for 
interconnection queue management and cost allocation.  This repository is 
used for engineering training bootcamps, interconnection study guides, and 
an interconnection roadmap for the [i2x project](https://energy.gov/i2x).  

## Users

The i2x DER package has been tested on Windows only, with Python 3.10.  It 
does net yet support Mac OS X or Linux.  During the installation process, 
a version of OpenDSS will be installed to work with the Python interface, 
i.e., you do not have to install OpenDSS separately.  The steps are: 

1. Install Python 3 if necessary. This is available from [Python Site](https://python.org), [Anaconda/Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), or the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-310/9PJPW5LDXLZ5).
2. From a command prompt[^1], `pip install i2x --upgrade`

Once installed, invoke the GUI from a command prompt[^1]: `i2x-der`

## Developers

The steps for deployment to PyPi are:

1. `rm -rf dist`
2. `python -m build`
3. `twine check dist/*` should not show any errors
4. `twine upload -r testpypi dist/*` requires project credentials for i2x on test.pypi.org
5. `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ i2x==0.0.2` for local testing of the deployable package, example version 0.0.2
6. `twine upload dist/*` final deployment; requires project credentials for i2x on pypi.org
