# pysoleng

pysoleng is a package designed to study solar energy and its applications. 

# What can it do now?

- Describe positions and surfaces on Earth (all continents);
- Identify the position of the sun over time;
- Calculate the direct radiation incidence angle on a flat surface;
- Estimate how much insolation reaches a given surface on Earth.

# Milestones

It would be interesting to add the following features to the package:

1) The ability to use other models for sloped surface radiation calculations, such as the anisotropic sky model;

2) The ability to estimate the performance of key solar energy technologies, namely solar thermal (ST) and photovoltaics (PV), using different models;

3) The ability to estimate parameters for solar thermal collector models.
