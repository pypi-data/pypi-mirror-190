# XYZPath
This package contains the `MoveAlongXYZPath` object. It is a simple utility that allows for moving across a path defined by an array of vectors (optionally with timestamps).  
I felt the need for this object since other methods don't really directly support this with its high level classes.

## Future works
- I might add some interpolation options to the object to allow for smooth movement with less samples.
