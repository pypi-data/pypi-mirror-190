# XYZPath
This package contains the `MoveAolongXYZPath` object. It is a simple utility that allows for moving across a path defined by an array of vectors (optionally with timestamps).  
I felt the need for this object since other methods don't really directly support this 

## Future works
- I might add some interpolation options to the object.
