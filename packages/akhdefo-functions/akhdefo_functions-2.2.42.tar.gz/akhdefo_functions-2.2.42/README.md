Computer Vision for Slope Stability: Land Deformation Monitoring Using Optical Satellite Imagery
# Background of Akh-Defo:
AKh-Defo is combination of two different words 1) Akh in Kurdish language means land, earth or soil (origion of the word is from Kurdish badini dailect) 2) Defo is short of English word deformation.
