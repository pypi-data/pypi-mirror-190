Welcome to yt_xarray's documentation!
======================================


yt_xarray streamlines communication between
`xarray <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/#>`_ and
`yt <https://yt-project.org>`_,
making it easier use yt's visualization and analysis methods with data
loaded via xarray.

Presently, yt_xarray primarily adds methods to generate a yt dataset from a
subset of xarray dataset fields, without making copies of data when possible.
