============

We provide several different examples so users can get a more practical grasp of how to use :code:`redback_surrogates`.

- `kilonovanet surrogate <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/examples/kilonovanet_example.py>`_

Furthermore, there are several examples in the :code:`redback` repository that can be easily modified to use :code:`redback_surrogates` to fit models to data.
Please see these examples `here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/examples/RedbackTutorial.ipynb>`_.
Replacing the models in many cases will be as simple as changing the model string.
