    We use the following formula to generate the data

    $$
    \ln Q' = \ln Q + \epsilon (\ln P' - \ln P)
    $$

    Define new log transformed variables to make this a linear relation

    $$
    y' = y + \epsilon (x' - x).
    $$

    For example, with initial condition

    ```
    initial_condition = {"price": 0, "sales": 10}
    ```

    For a deterministic model, we have

    ```python
    length = 10
    elasticity = [-3] * length
    prices = range(length)
    initial_condition = {"price: 0.5, "sale": 3}

    es = ElasticityStepper(

    next(es)

    !!! warning "Initial Condition"
        Initial condition is a dictionary with at least two keys `sale` and `price`.

        Note that the initial condition is NOT returned in the iterator.
