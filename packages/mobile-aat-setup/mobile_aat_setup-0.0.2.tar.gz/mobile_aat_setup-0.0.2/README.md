## How to use?

### Change package name

The function below replaces the middle part of the Android Project’s
package ID (the default is hilmarzech in com.hilmarzech.mobileaat).
Replacing this middle part should be sufficient to avoid conflicts with
existing installations and to upload your own version of the app to the
playstore.

``` python
!pip install mobile_aat_setup
```

``` python
from mobile_aat_setup import change_id
```

``` python
help(change_id.change_package_name)
```

    Help on function change_package_name in module mobile_aat_setup.change_id:

    change_package_name(path, newname, oldname='hilmarzech')
        # %% ../nbs/01_change_id.ipynb 6

``` python
PATH_TO_THE_ANDROID_STUDIO_PROJECT = "example/path"
NEWNAME = "examplename"
change_package_name(PATH_TO_THE_ANDROID_STUDIO_PROJECT, NEWNAME)
```

### Link to Firebase

After changing the package name, add an Android App with the new package
name (e.g. “com.examplename.mobileaat”) to Firebase. Next download the
google-services.json and place it into mobileaat/app.
