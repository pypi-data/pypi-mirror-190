A highly customizable way to play chess in your terminal! Supports online play (via Lichess.org) and
offline play against the Fairy-Stockfish engine. All Lichess variants are supported!
</p>

## Main Features
- Play online using your Lichess.org account
- Play offline against the Fairy-Stockfish engine
- Supports all Lichess [variants](https://lichess.org/variant)
- Theme the chess board and pieces to the colors of your choice
- Watch Lichess TV from the comfort of your terminal
- Supports SAN and UCI notation
- Play blindfold chess
- And more!

## Getting started
1. Open your terminal and run `pip install cli-chess`
2. Type `cli-chess` to start cli-chess
3. Use your keyboard arrows, tab, or click to navigate the menus. Multi value menu options
   (eg. changing the variant) can be cycled by pressing spacebar, enter, or by clicking
   on the value.

## Playing Online
In order to play online using your Lichess account you will need to create an API token for cli-chess to
authenticate with. Follow the steps below to create the token and register it with cli-chess. Generally, these
steps will only need to be run once as cli-chess will remember the API token.

1. Open your browser and login to your Lichess account
2. Click [here](https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token/create?scopes[]=board:play&scopes[]=challenge:read&scopes[]=challenge:write&description=cli-chess+token)
    to create a Lichess API token for cli-chess to authenticate with _(**NOTE**: Do not uncheck any of the
    token permissions as these are required by cli-chess)_
3. Click "Create"
4. Highlight and copy the token
5. Run cli-chess using the following command: `cli-chess --token ****` _(replace *'s with your API token)_

## Questions
#### 1. How do I make a move?
Moves in cli-chess must be made with SAN or UCI notation (eg. `e2e4` or `Nf3`).
Moves cannot be made using the mouse cursor.

#### 2. How do I increase the size of the board?
The only way to increase the size of the board is to increase the size of the
font you're using. Many terminals also support `Ctrl +` to increase the terminal size.

#### 3. The board or chess pieces aren't aligned properly, how can I fix this?
As cli-chess is a terminal based program, it has been designed to be used
with a monospace type font. A monospace font should always be used with cli-chess
in order for character alignment to be consistent. The display of cli-chess can change
drastically depending on the font being used, so it's important to choose a monospace
type font that works best for your terminal and display preferences. The monospace fonts
that I have found to work best with cli-chess for piece alignment are `Ubuntu Mono` and `MS Gothic`.

#### 4. What operating systems does cli-chess support?
cli-chess development is mainly focused to support Linux. While cli-chess will work on
other operating systems (such as Windows and macOS) the support priority will
be directed towards Linux. Regardless of operating system please report any issues
found, and I will do my best to support.

#### 5. What versions of Python are supported?
cli-chess supports Python >= 3.7

#### 5. Does cli-chess support other chess engines?
Playing offline vs the computer is _currently_ only directly compatible with the [Fairy-Stockfish](<https://fairy-stockfish.github.io/>) engine.
For simplicity, the Fairy-Stockfish binaries come pre-built with cli-chess for Linux, Windows, and macOS _(x86_64 architecture)_.
