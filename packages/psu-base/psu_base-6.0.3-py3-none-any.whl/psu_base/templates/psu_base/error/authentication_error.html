    <h1>Authentication Error</h1>
    You are currently logged in as <span class="code">{{request.user}}</span>,
    which cannot be associated with a know person.
    <br />
    <br />

    Common reasons for this can include:
    <ul>
        <li>You logged in with a service account (an account shared by multiple people)</li>
        <li>You logged in with your privileged account (a "high" account)</li>
        <li>You logged in with an email address rather than your Odin username</li>
        <li>There may have been a temporary database connection error</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <div class="well" style="text-align:center;font-size:1.5em;">
        Please <a href="{%url 'cas:logout'%}">log out</a> and log back in using your personal PSU Odin account credentials.
    </div>
    <br />
