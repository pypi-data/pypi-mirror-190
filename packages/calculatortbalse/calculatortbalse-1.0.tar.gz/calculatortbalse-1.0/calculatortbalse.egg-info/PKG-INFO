### A project at Turing College

## Installing the package

    pip install calculatortbalse
    
## Testing the package
After installation, you can launch the test suite from outside the package directory.

    pytest calculatortbalse

## Using the package
### Initiate Calculator object
Calculator has internal memory, initiated at 0.0 by default. All methods can work with any float or int.
```Python
>>> calculator = Calculator()
>>> print(calculator)
Currently calculator reads: 0.0
```
However, you can pass in a number that will be stored in memory instead of 0.0
```Python
>>> calculator = Calculator(2)
>>> print(calculator)
Currently calculator reads: 2.0
```
### Reset internal memory
Similar to initiating a Calculator object, reset method can store the provided float in memory. Resets to 0.0 if no value is given.
```Python
>>> calculator.reset()
>>> print(calculator)
Currently calculator reads: 0.0
```
### Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
add, subtract, multiply, divide methods accept any float and return a formatted string.
```Python
>>> calculator.reset()
>>> calculator.add(2)
'Currently calculator reads: 2.0'
>>> calculator.subtract(1)
'Currently calculator reads: 1.0'
>>> calculator.multiply(9)
'Currently calculator reads: 9.0'
>>> calculator.divide(3)
'Currently calculator reads: 3.0'
```
### Take n-th degree root
root method takes the n-th degree root of the number curently stored in memory. Can only take roots of positive numbers.
```Python
>>> calculator.reset(8)
>>> calculator.root(3)
'Currently calculator reads: 2.0'
```
