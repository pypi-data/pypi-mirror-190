The resources are requested batch-wise, i. e. only one batch of responses is kept in memory (depends of course also on how you use the `ResponseIterator`).\n\nFor example, if you set `batch_size` to `2`, have four resources and execute:\n\n```python\n>>> next(responses)\n```\n\nthe first two resources are requested in parallel and blocks until both of the responses are available (i.e. if resource 1 takes 1 second and resource 2 takes 10 seconds, it blocks 10 seconds although resource 1 is already available after 1 second). The response of resource 1 is yielded.\n\nExecuting `next()` a second time:\n\n```python\n>>> next(response)\n```\n\nwill be super fast, because the response of resource 2 is already available. Executing `next()` a third time will be "slow" again, because the next batch of resources is requested.\n\nHowever, there is also a convenience function for POST requests:\n\n```python\n>>> resources = [\n...     {"url": "https://httpbin.org/post"},\n...     {"url": "https://httpbin.org/post", "json": {"foo": "bar"}},\n...     {"url": "invalid"},\n... ]\n>>> responses = mure.post(resources)\n```\n\nYou can even mix HTTP methods in the list of resources (but have to specify the method for each resource):\n\n```python\n>>> resources = [\n...     {"method": "GET", "url": "https://httpbin.org/get"},\n...     {"method": "GET", "url": "https://httpbin.org/get", "params": {"foo": "bar"}},\n...     {"method": "POST", "url": "https://httpbin.org/post"},\n...     {"method": "POST", "url": "https://httpbin.org/post", "json": {"foo": "bar"}},\n...     {"method": "GET", "url": "invalid"},\n... ]\n>>> responses = mure.request(resources)\n```\n',
