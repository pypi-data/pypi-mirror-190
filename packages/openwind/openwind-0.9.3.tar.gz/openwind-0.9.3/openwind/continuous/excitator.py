    Reed excitator (cane or lips): non-linear excitator

    A reed excitator is used to model both brass (lips-reeds) and woodwind
    (cane-reed) instruments. It can be, following [Fletcher]_ nomeclature, an:

    - outwards valve (lips-reeds) for brass: the reed opens when the supply \
    pressure is higher than the pressure inside the instrument
    - inwards valve (cane-reed) for simple or double reed instruments: the reed \
    opens when the supply pressure is smaller than the pressure inside the\
    instrument

    The reed is modelled by a 1D damped mass-spring oscillator following
    [Bilbao]_. The contact at closure is modelled through a penalizating term.

    .. math::
        \\begin{align}
        &\\ddot{y} + 2 \\sigma \\dot{y} + \\omega_0^2 (y - y_0) - \
            \\frac{\\omega_1^{\\alpha+1}}{y_0^{\\alpha-1}}(|[y]^{-}|)^{\\alpha}\
            = - \\epsilon \\frac{S_r \\Delta p}{M_r} \\\\
        &\\Delta p = p_m - p \\\\
        & u = w [y]^{+} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 |\\Delta p|}{\\rho}} sign(\\Delta p) \
            - Sr \\dot{y}
        \\end{align}

    With :math:`y` the position of the reed, :math:`[y]^{\\pm}` the positive
    or negative part of :math:`y`, :math:`p,u` the acoustic fields inside the
    instrument and :math:`\\rho` the air density.

    The other coefficients must be specified by the user. They are:

    - "opening" :math:`y_0` : the resting opening height of the reed (in m)
    - "mass" :math:`M_r` : the effective mass of the reed (in kg)
    - "section" :math:`S_r` : the effective vibrating surface of the reed  \
    (and not the opening) (in mÂ²)
    - "pulsation" :math:`\\omega_0` : the resonant angular frequency of the reed
    - "dissip" :math:`\\sigma` : the damping coefficient
    - "width" :math:`w` : the effective width of the reed channel opening (in m)
    - "mouth_pressure" :math:`p_m` : the supply pressure (in Pa)
    - "model" : string coefficient that specifies if it is a "cane" (inwards)\
        or "lips" (inwards) reed. It fixes the value of :math:`\\epsilon` to \
        1 (cane) or -1 (lips)
    - "contact_pulsation" :math:`\\omega_1` : the angular frequency associated\
        to the contact law when the reed is closed.
    - "contact_exponent" :math:`\\alpha` : the exponent associated to the \
        contact law when the reed is closed.


    .. warning::
        This excitator can be used only in temporal domain

    ----------

        The basis functions for our finite elements must be of regularity
