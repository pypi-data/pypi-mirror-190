    Light-Pipe is an extensible, light-weight Python framework for data pipelines that scale. It provides a set of intuitive abstractions designed to decouple pipeline implementation from the operations performed within the pipeline. It is designed to scale effortlessly, being built from the ground-up to support concurrency in all its forms, and it has zero non-standard dependencies. Light-Pipe is released under a BSD-3-Clause License.
