# RichValues

Python 3 library for dealing with numeric values with uncertainties and upper/lower limits, which we may call _rich values_. With it, one can import rich values written in plain text documents in an easily readable format, operate with them propagating the uncertainties automatically, and export them in the same formatting style as the import.

The libraries NumPy, Pandas, SciPy and Matplotlib are required. You can check the user guide on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/andresmegias.
