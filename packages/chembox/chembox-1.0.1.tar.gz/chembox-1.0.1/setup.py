It is designed to intelligently process text input containing the chemical formula and provide associated information on the inquired molecule. It is able to provide the molar mass, check a formula\'s validity, and provide a balanced combustion equation if the input is combustible. This tool can be utilized for various educational and research purposes for simple and fast information retrieval.\n\nWe are using a dataset that contains established element data properties from [this site](https://github.com/Bluegrams/periodic-table-data/blob/master/Periodica.Data/Data/ElementData.csv).\n\n## Installation\n\n`chembox` is developed and tested on Python 3.10. You can install it from PyPi via pip:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install chembox\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe package includes 4 functions for solving chemistry problems:\n\n- `get_elements`a parser that takes a chemical formula in string format and returns a dictionary that contains the elements and their respective count. \n\n- `is_valid`: a checker that returns a boolean indicating whether a given input is chemically reasonable.\n\n- `get_molec_props`: a method that takes a chemical formula in string format and returns a dataframe with various useful properties of each element in the formula.\n\n- `get_combustion_equation`: a method that takes a text chemical formula that only contains carbon (`C`) and hydrogen (`H`) and outputs a balanced equation resulting from combustion.\n\nA detailed example of usage can be found [here](https://chembox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html).\n\n## Dataset\n\nIn order to be able to perform some of the functions above, a dataset will need to be used that contains various atomic properties of the elements in the periodic table. The data can be found in the Chembox repo [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/chembox/tree/main/src/chembox/data) which was sourced from [here](https://github.com/Bluegrams/periodic-table-data/tree/master/Periodica.Data/Data). Please note that we do not take credit for the dataset, it is merely for use with our functions.\n\n## Fitting into the Python ecosystem\n\nA similar package [chemsolve](https://github.com/amogh7joshi/chemsolve) is available online that employs a similar string-parsing design and molar mass calculation.\n\nWhat we do differently:\n\n- We include a dataframe of the molecule properties to give the user enhanced functionality and insights.\n\n- `chemsolve` accepts user-defined reactions. In our package, we include methods for automated combustion equation generation and balancing.\n\n## Contributing\n\nInterested in contributing? Check out the contributing guidelines.
