We are continuously working on new scenarios - and our current scenario repo consists of over 60 scenarios that are listed [here](scenarios/index.md). They are developed with the intent of being easy-to-use for business. The framework also supports a whole bunch of [custom scenarios](TODO/custom-scenarios.md).\n\n## Install **VisionAI**\n\nInstall **VisionAI** application through `PyPI`. There are other options available for install - including a Docker container option. These are detailed in [installation](TODO/install.md) section.\n\n```console\n$ pip install visionai\n---> 100%\nSuccessfully installed visionai\n\n✨ You are all set to use visionai toolkit ✨\n```\n\n## Deploy to **Azure**\n\nDeploy a fully configured and tested solution directly from Azure Marketplace. **VisionAI** runs computer vision models, most of which run orders of magnitude faster if executed on a GPU machine. Our Azure Marketplace offer **VisionAI Community Edition** is available through Azure Marketplace [here](https://azure.microsoft.com) (TODO). The community edition deploys a fully configured Virtual Machine with the recommended hardware and software options. Get more details [here](azure/installation.md).\n\n![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)\n\n- TODO: Point to ARM template that needs to be deployed (using these [instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-azure-button) and here is an example [JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/quickstarts/microsoft.storage/storage-account-create/azuredeploy.json)).\n\n## List available **Scenarios**\n\n**VisionAI** is organized in terms of scenarios. Consider each scenario as being a business use-case, that is solved by a combination of Machine Learning models and an inference algorithm. For example *Warn me when max occupancy of this area exceeds 80 people* is a business scenario, where as the *People detection* is an ML model.\n\n**VisionAI** supports 60 scenarios currently and more are being added continuously. Our current focus is on Workplace Safety scenarios. Please [contact us](contact.md) if a scenario you need is not present in our repo and we will look into it.\n\n```console\n$ visionai scenarios list\n\n------------------------------------------------\nPrivacy Suite\nblur-faces\nblur-text\n\nFire safety\nearly-smoke-and-fire-detection\nsmoking-and-vaping-detection\n\nPersonnel safety\nppe-detection\npfas-system-detection\nrailings-detection\n\nSuspicious activity\nshipping-activity-detection\nagressive-behaivior\n\n\nCompliance Policies\nmax-occupancy\n\nEquipment\nrust-and-corrosion-detection\n\nIR Camera\ntemperature-monitoring\n------------------------------------------------\n\n✨ More scenarios are added regularly ✨\n```\n\n\n## Get details for a **Scenario**\n\nYou can get details about a scenario using `visionai scenario details` command. Specify the scenario you want additional details for. The details of a scenario include the dataset size, model accuracy metrics,\n\n```console\n$ visionai scenario --name early-smoke-and-fire-detection details\n\n------------------------------------------------\nCategory: Fire safety\nScenario: early-smoke-and-fire-detection\nThis scenario has been trained on open-source datasets consisting of 126,293 images. The datasets images are primarily outdoors (70%), but do contain a good number of indoor images (30%). There is a ~50-50% mix of day vs night images. You can find more details about this scenario at visionify.ai/early-smoke-and-fire-detection.\n\n\nModel: smoke-and-fire-detection-1.0.1.pt\nModel size: 127MB\nModel type: Object Detection\nFramework: PyTorch\n\nModel performance:\nDataset size: 126,293 images\nAccuracy: 94.1%\nRecall: 93%\nF1-Score: 93.5%\n\nEvents:\nsmoke-detected  | Immediate\nfire-detected   | Immediate\n\nEvent examples:\n{\n    "scenario": "smoke-and-fire-detection",\n    "event_name": "smoke-detected",\n    "event_details": {\n        "camera": "camera-01",\n        "date": "2023-01-04 11:05:02",\n        "confidence": 0.92\n    }\n}\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```\n\n## Run a **Scenario**\n\nUse `visionai run` command to run a scenario. In its simplest sense, you can run a single scenario on your web-cam. In a more complex use-case, you can specify a pipeline of scenarios, configure notification logic for each scenario, timings for each scenario etc.\n\n```console\n$ visionai run --scenario early-smoke-and-fire-detection --camera OFFICE-01\n\nStarting early-smoke-and-fire-detection\n...\n\n```\n\n## Install **Web App**\nUse `visionai install web` command to install webapp. It will clone latest docker image from docker hub `visionify/visionaiweb`. Use `visionai web --help` for to get insigt about webapp.\n\n\n\n## Next **steps**\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully run the first scenario. Now go through [Tutorials](tutorials/index.md) to learn about how to run multiple scnearios, how to configure each scenario for the events you need, how to set up the dependencies etc.\n\nOr you can also go through our [scenarios](scenarios/index.md) page to explore the different scenarios available and their model details. If you have a need for a scenario to be implemented, do not hesitate to submit a [request](https://github.com/visionify/visionai/issues).\n\n',
