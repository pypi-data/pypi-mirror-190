# ibm-zdnn-plugin

The ibm-zdnn-plugin is a device plugin for TensorFlow ([PluggableDevice](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2021/06/pluggabledevice-device-plugins-for-TensorFlow.html)) that leverages the [IBM z Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/IBM/zDNN) (zDNN) library for accelerated inferencing. The zDNN library contains a set of primitives that support Deep Neural Networks. These primitives transparently target the IBM Integrated Accelerator for AI on IBM z16™ hardware.
