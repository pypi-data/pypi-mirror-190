    "## Motivation\n",
    "When building IOT devices, we often want them to **see and understand** the world around them.\n",
    "This can take many forms, but often times a device will want to know if a certain **kind of\n",
    "object** is in its field of vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a security camera might look for **people**, so it can decide whether to save a video\n",
    "to memory. A traffic light might look for **cars**, so it can judge which lights should change\n",
    "first. Or a forest camera might look for a **kind of animal**, so they can estimate how large\n",
    "the animal population is.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make these devices affordable, we would like them to need only a low-cost processor like the\n",
    "[nRF52840](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF52840) (costing five dollars each on Mouser) or the [RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/) (just $1.45 each!).\n",
    "\n",
    "These devices have very little memory (~250 KB RAM), meaning that no conventional edge AI\n",
    "vision model (like MobileNet or EfficientNet) will be able to run. In this tutorial, we will\n",
    "show how these models can be modified to work around this requirement. Then, we will use TVM\n",

    "which contains 16,185 full color images of cars. We'll also need images of random things that\n",

    "\n",
    "We could use the TensorFlow dataloader utilities, but we'll instead do it manually to make sure\n",

    "## Loading the Data\n",
    "In the past decade, [convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) have been widely\n",
    "adopted for image classification tasks. State-of-the-art models like [EfficientNet V2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00298) are able\n",
    "to perform image classification better than even humans! Unfortunately, these models have tens of\n",
    "millions of parameters, and thus won't fit on cheap security camera computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our applications generally don't need perfect accuracy - 90% is good enough. We can thus use the\n",
    "older and smaller MobileNet V1 architecture. But this *still* won't be small enough - by default,\n",
    "MobileNet V1 with 224x224 inputs and alpha 1.0 takes ~50 MB to just **store**. To reduce the size\n",
    "of the model, there are three knobs we can turn. First, we can reduce the size of the input images\n",
    "from 224x224 to 96x96 or 64x64, and Keras makes it easy to do this. We can also reduce the **alpha**\n",
    "of the model, from 1.0 to 0.25, which downscales the width of the network (and the number of\n",
    "filters) by a factor of four. And if we were really strapped for space, we could reduce the\n",
    "number of **channels** by making our model take grayscale images instead of RGB ones.\n",

    "ideal, but it allows the finished model to fit in 192 KB of RAM, while still letting us perform\n",
    "transfer learning using the official TensorFlow source models (if we used alpha <0.25 or a\n",
    "grayscale input, we wouldn't be able to do this).\n",

    "### What is Transfer Learning?\n",
    "Deep learning has [dominated image classification](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet) for a long time,\n",
    "but training neural networks takes a lot of time. When a neural network is trained \"from scratch\",\n",
    "its parameters start out randomly initialized, forcing it to learn very slowly how to tell images\n",
    "apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "With transfer learning, we instead start with a neural network that's **already** good at a\n",
    "specific task. In this example, that task is classifying images from [the ImageNet database](https://www.image-net.org/). This\n",
    "means the network already has some object detection capabilities, and is likely closer to what you\n",
    "want then a random model would be.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works especially well with image processing neural networks like MobileNet. In practice, it\n",
    "turns out the convolutional layers of the model (i.e. the first 90% of the layers) are used for\n",
    "identifying low-level features like lines and shapes - only the last few fully connected layers\n",
    "are used to determine how those shapes make up the objects the network is trying to detect.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take advantage of this by starting training with a MobileNet model that was trained on\n",
    "ImageNet, and already knows how to identify those lines and shapes. We can then just remove the\n",
    "last few layers from this pretrained model, and add our own final layers. We'll then train this\n",
    "conglomerate model for a few epochs on our cars vs non-cars dataset, to adjust the first layers\n",
    "and train from scratch the last layers. This process of training an already-partially-trained\n",

    "it's poorly supported by development boards and does not support autotuning. We will use Apache\n",
    "TVM instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "TVM can be used either with its command line interface (``tvmc``) or with its Python interface. The\n",
    "Python interface is fully-featured and more stable, so we'll use it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "TVM is an optimizing compiler, and optimizations to our model are performed in stages via\n",
    "**intermediate representations**. The first of these is [Relay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00952) a high-level intermediate\n",
    "representation emphasizing portability. The conversion from ``.tflite`` to Relay is done without any\n",
    "knowledge of our \"end goal\" - the fact we intend to run this model on an Arduino.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing an Arduino Board\n",
    "Next, we'll have to decide exactly which Arduino board to use. The Arduino sketch that we\n",
    "ultimately generate should be compatible with any board, but knowing which board we are using in\n",
    "advance allows TVM to adjust its compilation strategy to get better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one catch - we need enough **memory** (flash and RAM) to be able to run our model. We\n",
    "won't ever be able to run a complex vision model like a MobileNet on an Arduino Uno - that board\n",
    "only has 2 kB of RAM and 32 kB of flash! Our model has ~200,000 parameters, so there is just no\n",
    "way it could fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will use the Nano 33 BLE, which has 1 MB of flash memory and 256 KB of RAM.\n",
    "However, any other Arduino with those specs or better should also work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating our project\n",
    "Next, we'll compile the model to TVM's MLF (model library format) intermediate representation,\n",
    "which consists of C/C++ code and is designed for autotuning. To improve performance, we'll tell\n",
    "TVM that we're compiling for the ``nrf52840`` microprocessor (the one the Nano 33 BLE uses). We'll\n",
    "also tell it to use the C runtime (abbreviated ``crt``) and to use ahead-of-time memory allocation\n",
    "(abbreviated ``aot``, which helps reduce the model's memory footprint). Lastly, we will disable\n",
    "vectorization with ``\"tir.disable_vectorize\": True``, as C has no native vectorized types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have set these configuration parameters, we will call ``tvm.relay.build`` to compile our\n",
