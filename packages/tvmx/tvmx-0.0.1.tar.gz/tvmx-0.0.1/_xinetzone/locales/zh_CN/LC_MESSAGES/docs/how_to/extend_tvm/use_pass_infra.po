"As the number of optimization passes increases in Relay/tir, it becomes "
"intractable to execute them and maintain their dependencies manually. "
"Therefore, we have introduced an infrastructure to manage the "
"optimization passes and make it applicable to different layers of the IR "
"in the TVM stack."

"The optimizations of a Relay/tir program could be applied at various "
"granularity, namely function-level and module-level using "
":py:class:`tvm.relay.transform.FunctionPass`/ "
":py:class:`tvm.tir.transform.PrimFuncPass` and "
":py:class:`tvm.transform.ModulePass` respectively. Or users can rely on "
":py:class:`tvm.transform.Sequential` to apply a sequence of passes on a "
"Relay/tir program where the dependencies between passes can be resolved "
"by the pass infra. For more details about each type of these passes, "

"Applying passes as above is actually tedious and it may require users to "
"have better understanding about the dependencies between them. For "
"example, fusion currently doesn't work well on let bindings. Therefore, "
"we would not be able to fuse operators that were fusable if "
":py:func:`relay.transform.ToANormalForm` is applied before fusion, as "
"this pass generates let bindings for each expression to canonicalize a "
"Relay program."

"Relay, hence, provides :py:class:`tvm.transform.Sequential` to alleviate "
"developers from handling these issues explicitly by specifying the "
"required passes of each pass and packing them as a whole to execute. For "
"example, the same passes can now be applied using the sequential style as"
" the following. :py:class:`tvm.transform.Sequential` is similiar to "
"`torch.nn.sequential "
"<https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Sequential>`_ and "
"`mxnet.gluon.block "
"<https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/docs/_modules/mxnet/gluon/block.html>`_."
" For example, `torch.nn.sequential` is used to contain a sequence of "
"PyTorch `Modules` that will be added to build a network. It focuses on "
"the network layers. Instead, the :py:class:`tvm.transform.Sequential` in "
"our pass infra works on the optimizing pass."

"From the transformed Relay program, we can see that there are still two "
"identical addition operations. This is because ``EliminateCommonSubexpr``"
" was not actually performed. The reason is because only the passes that "
"have optimization level less or equal to 2 will be executed by default "
"under :py:class:`tvm.transform.Sequential`. The pass infra, however, "
"provides a configuration interface for users to customize the "
"optimization level that they want to execute."

"In addition, users can selectively disable some passes using the "

"the general purpose compilers, such as Clang and GCC. For example, we can"
" disable EliminateCommonSubexpr as following. The printed module will "

"The next example illustrates how we can orchestrate a customized "
"optimization pipeline through the pass infra using Python decorators. "
"This functionality greatly eases the implementation of passes. For "
"example, users can simply define a decorated class to do function-level "
"optimizations as the following example shows. `transform_function` wraps "
"a class to replace all constants with a multiple of `c`. Later on, each "
"function in a given module will be visited and each constant in the "
"function will be replaced when we invoke the customized pass."

"TVM provides users a plug-and-play style debugging pass that print the IR"
