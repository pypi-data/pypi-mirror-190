"TVM traditionally exports generated libraries as Dynamic Shared Objects "
"(e.g. DLLs (Windows) or .so (linux)). Inferences can be performed using "
"those libraries by loading them into an executable using "
"``libtvm_runtime.so``. This process is very dependent on services "
"provided by traditional OS."

msgid ""
"For deployment to unconventional platforms (e.g. those lacking "
"traditional OS), TVM provides another output format, Model Library "
"Format. Initially, the microTVM project is the primary use case for this "
"format. Should it become useful in other use cases (and in particular, "
"should it become possible to export BYOC artifacts in Model Library "
"Format), it could be used as a general-purpose TVM export format.  Model "
"Library Format is a tarball containing a file for each piece of the TVM "
"compiler output."
