It does so by relying on specific conventions for project structure  described below.\n\nUse cases are sorted by increasing complexity.\n\n## \\[NOT IMPLEMENTED\\] The simplest case\nYou made a single Jupyter notebook that:\n* takes as input a training dataset location\n* preprocess data using Pandas\n* train model using scikit-learn\n* evaluate model using scikit-learn\n* uses one of the predefined kernels of Sagemaker Studio as an execution environment.\n* You have not changed this environment with `pip install`s. If you did then check the next use case.\n\n### You prepared / Project Structure:\n```\n<PROJECT_ROOT>\n  |-- my_project07.ipynb\n```\n\n### Library usage:\nTo build and deploy pipeline (in SageMaker) use the following CLI command:\n```\nmlops upsert-pipeline TODO header of help description for this command\n```\nor from code:\n```python\nfrom mlops_utilities.actions import upsert_pipeline\n...\nTODO\nupsert_pipeline(TODO args example)\n```\n\nTo execute the previously upserted pipeline:\n```\nmlops run-pipeline TODO\n```\n\nTraining pipeline execution produces new model version in model registry. To deploy it onto real-time endpoint use the following CLI command:\n```\nmlops deploy-model TODO\n```\n\n## \\[NOT IMPLEMENTED\\] The "simple" layout\nTODO - The same as default layout but without writing pipeline definition using SageMaker SDK.\n\n## The "default" layout\nIf you separated code of different pipeline steps and defined training pipeline using SageMaker SDK.\n\n### You prepared / Project Structure:\n```\n<PROJECT_ROOT>\n  |-- components\n          |-- preprocessing\n                  |-- preprocess.py\n                  |__ requirements.txt\n          |-- training\n                  |__ train.py\n          |__ <folders for other steps>\n  |-- pipelines\n          |-- training_pipeline.py\n          |-- training_pipeline.defaults.conf\n          |-- inference_pipeline.py\n          |__ inference_pipeline.defaults.conf\n```\n### Structure of Pipeline Definition Script\nTODO\n\n### Component Structure and Environments\nTODO\n\n### Library usage:\nTo build and deploy pipeline (in SageMaker) use the following CLI command:\n```\nmlops upsert-pipeline TODO header of help description for this command\n```\nor from code:\n```python\nfrom mlops_utilities.actions import upsert_pipeline\n...\nTODO\nupsert_pipeline(TODO args example)\n```\n\nTo execute the previously upserted pipeline:\n```\nmlops run-pipeline TODO\n```\n\nTraining pipeline execution produces new model version in model registry.
