BIRD interface handler for Python

PyBird is a Python interface to the BIRD Internet Routing Daemon's UNIX control
socket, handling the socket connections and parsing the output. It was
originally written by [Sasha Romijn](https://github.com/mxsasha), forked from
the original BitBucket repository, and relicensed with permission.


In it's current state, you can use it to query the status of specific or all
BGP peers, to query the routes received, accepted and rejected from a peer,
or the general status of BIRD (router ID, last config change)
