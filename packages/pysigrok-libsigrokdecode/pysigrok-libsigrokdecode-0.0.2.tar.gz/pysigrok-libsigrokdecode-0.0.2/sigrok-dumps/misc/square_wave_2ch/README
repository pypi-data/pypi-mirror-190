Setup
-----

The oscilloscope has the following options in the 'Save/Recall' menu, that
can be used to save the acquired/displayed data on a USB thumb drive:

 - Trace and Setup
  - Used to store the data *in* the scope (not on USB thumb drive)
 - BMP (8-bit) image file
  - Options: Setup info = y/n, Invert Grat = y/n, Palette = Color/Grayscale
 - BMP (24-bit) image file
  - Options: Setup info = y/n, Invert Grat = y/n, Palette = Color/Grayscale
 - PNG (24-bit) image file
  - Options: Setup info = y/n, Invert Grat = y/n, Palette = Color/Grayscale
 - CSV data file
  - Options: Setup info = y/n, Length = 100/250/500/1000
 - ASCII XY data file
  - Options: Setup info = y/n, Length = x
    (x = 100/250/500/1000/2000/5000/10000/20000/50000/100000/200000/500000
     1000000/2000000)
 - ALB data file
  - Options: Setup info = y/n, Length = x (see above),
    Alb serial format = Default/CAN/I2C/LIN/UART|RS232/SPI2/SPI3/SPI4
 - BIN data file
  - Options: Setup info = y/n, Length = x (see above)
 - Lister data file
  - No options

When "Setup info" is enabled, the scope also saves an additional file
with the respective basename and a *.txt extention (e.g. "scope_0.txt"),
which contains some ASCII info about the scope setup, any measurements
displayed on the LCD, and so on.


Files
-----

Channels 1 and 2 of the (4-channel) scope were connected to the test output
of the scope (used for probe impedance matching), which outputs a 1.2kHz
square wave signal with an amplitude of 2.5V (2.72V peak-to-peak).

After the "Stop" button was pressed, the following files were saved:

 scope_0: BMP (8-bit)
 scope_1: BMP (24-bit)
 scope_2: PNG (24-bit)
 scope_3: CSV, 1000
 scope_4: CSV, 500
 scope_5: CSV, 250
 scope_6: CSV, 100
 scope_7: ASCII XY, 100
 scope_8: ASCII XY, 250
 ...
 scope_19: ASCII XY, 1000000
 scope_20: ASCII XY, 2000000
 scope_21: ALB, 100, Default
 scope_22: ALB, 100, CAN
 scope_23: ALB, 100, I2C
 scope_24: ALB, 100, LIN
 scope_25: ALB, 100, UART/RS232
 scope_26: ALB, 100, SPI2 (SPI3/4 cannot be be used with only 2 channels)
 scope_27: BIN, 100
 scope_28: BIN, 250
 scope_29: BIN, 500
 scope_30: Lister
 
Only two "Setup info" files are included, scope_0.txt and scope_4.txt.
The first one is valid (and identical) for files scope_0* to scope_3*, the
latter is valid (and identical) for the files scope_4* to scope_30*.

The *.bin files contain the device's serial number. This has been changed
(via hex editor) to "MY12345678" in the files.
