This is an example capture showing an FSK datastream from a
Lazer Tag LTAR blaster.

The original data stream is audio-FSK in an iPhone-compatible format.
This capture was made with a little bit of hardware to get it digitized,
as my capture hardware didn't have sufficient analog resolution to let the
PulseView analog-to-logic conversion work well. The FSK decoder defaults to
settings that work well for this particular usage, so just open the file and
add the FSK decoder.
