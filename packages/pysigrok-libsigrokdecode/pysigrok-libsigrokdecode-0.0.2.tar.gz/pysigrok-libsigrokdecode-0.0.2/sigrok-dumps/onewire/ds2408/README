Maxim DS2408 1-Wire 8-Channel Addressable Switch
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a set of example captures of the 1-Wire traffic from a Maxim Integrated
(previously Dallas Semiconductor) DS2408 1-Wire Addressable Switch.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The waveform data was acquired using Rigol DS1074Z oscilloscope.

Because of the currently unresolved libsigrok bug #1364 it can't be acquired
directly using rigol-ds, so it was obtained using external tool and then
loaded into PulseView with "Import Raw analog data without header".

This method is described here:

disable-test-mode.sr
--------------------

This is the special "Disable Test Mode" command which should be issued on the
power-on, for reference read "Power-up timing", page 38 of the datasheet.


channel-access-write.sr
-----------------------

A successful command for setting PIO outputs (channel access write).


channel-access-write-fail.sr
----------------------------

Same command as above but the device is responding with 'Fail New State' (0xff)
which informs about the error.


read-pio-registers.sr
---------------------

A function for reading device registers (where a target address is given).
In this example the address 0x89 is read (PIO output-latch state register).
