Several .sr files for testing of SPDIF.

Use channel D6 for testing. The test signal is a 44,1kHz 2 channel audio signal (2.822Mbit/s).

spdif_16mhz_44khz.sr:
Original decoder is lucky to enter the stream with pulses of medium length. OK.
New decoder recognizes short pulses (width <= 3 samples) and reports an error. OK.

spdif_16mhz_44khz_3.sr:
Original decoder decodes wrong because of false pulse width detection at the beginning. Fail.
New decoder recognizes short pulses (width <= 3 samples) and reports an error. OK.

spdif_24mhz_44khz_1.sr:
Original decoder doesn't find any frames because of long low level phase before the data stream. Fail.
Now decoder correctly decodes stream after synchronisation (First frame is missed). OK.
