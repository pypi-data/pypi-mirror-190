Arbitrary CEC bus traffic
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These captures contain the typical command exchange between 2 CEC capable
devices. In this case a Sony TV and 2 different amplifiers were used.

The captures were taken connecting the TV and one of the amplifiers to later on
switch the TV off and back on while dumping traffic on the CEC bus.

The power OFF and power ON sequence can be seen in the captures with the 
2 different amplifiers (Yamaha / Denon).

Another spare capture was performed connecting one amplifier to the ARC input
of the TV.


Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The captures were taken using a Saleae Logic (fx2lafw), sampling at a rate of 
1MHz. Channel 3 of the analyzer is used for the CEC bus traffic.
