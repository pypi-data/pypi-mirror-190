STMicroelectronics M93C66 Microwire EEPROM
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a set of example captures of the Microwire traffic from a
STMicroelectronics M93C66 Microwire EEPROM.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was an MCU123 Saleae Logic clone (at 4MHz):

  Probe       M93C66 pin
  ----------------------
  1           S / CS
  3           C / SK
  4           D / SI
  5           Q / SO

M93C66 pin 6 (ORG) was tied high to use the x16 memory organisation (i.e.,
16-bit words).

PulseView was used to capture the trace with the following parameters:

  - sample rate: 4 MHz
  - samples: 50 k
  - trigger: rising channel 1 (CS)
  - pre-trigger: 5%

The M93C66 EEPROM has the same following marking:

      C66WP
  (ST) K431

The communication is initiated by a custom software implementation for a
STM32F103C8 using the Microwire protocol as master.

The master performs the following actions:

 - Read 16-bits word 0x4242 at 8-bit address 0x0
 - Read first words (4x 0x4242) starting at address 0x0
 - Enable write and erase
 - Erase word at address 0x0 and wait until ready
 - Erase complete EEPROM and wait until ready
 - Write word 0x4242 at address 0x0 and wait until ready
 - Write word 0x4242 on complete EEPROM and wait until ready
 - Disable write and erase
