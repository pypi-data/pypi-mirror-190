Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a Saleae Logic16 (at 50/100 MHz):

  Probe       AD1981A
  -------------------
  0           BIT_CLK
  1           SDATA_IN
  2           SYNC
  3           RESET# (only in the 50MHz captures)

SDATA_OUT never toggled, so it was omitted.

-------------------------

The data is the first chunk of traffic that occurs on an random mainboard
(which contains the AD1981A) during BIOS power-up.


ac97_ad1981a_powerup2*.sr
-------------------------

Same as above, but this is a snippet of the second chunk of data that occurs
a few seconds after the first chunk.
