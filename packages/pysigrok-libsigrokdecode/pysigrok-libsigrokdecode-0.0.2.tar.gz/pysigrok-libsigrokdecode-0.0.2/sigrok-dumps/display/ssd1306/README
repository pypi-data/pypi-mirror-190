SSD1306 OLED display controller, 4-wire SPI and I2C modes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This capture contains a sequence of an SSD1306 display controller which is
popular for OLED display modules. The controller supports various protocols.
I2C and 4-wire SPI are used most often.


Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The 4-wire SPI capture was taken with DreamSourceLab DSLogic logic analyzer,
sampling 4 logic channels at a rate of 10MHz:

  Probe       SSD1306
  -------------------
  0           CLK  (clock)
  1           MOSI (master out, slave in)
  2           DC   (data / command)
  3           CS   (chip select)

The I2C capture was taken with DreamSourceLab DSLogic logic analyzer,
sampling 2 logic channels at a rate of 2MHz:

  Probe       SSD1306
  -------------------
  0           SCL (clock)
  1           SDA (data)
