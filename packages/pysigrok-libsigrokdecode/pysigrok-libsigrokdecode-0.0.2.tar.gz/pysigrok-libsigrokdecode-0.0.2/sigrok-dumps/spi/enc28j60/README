enc28j60-init-and-ping.sr
-------------------------

Capture contains the following 3 stages:

1) Initialization phase where control registers are written.
2) Polling phase that waits for the Ethernet link to be up.
3) Two round-trips of ping packets (each consists of 1 RX of ICMP Echo Request
   packet and 1 TX of ICMP Echo Reply packet).

The chip was driven by a custom STM32F446 board running custom bare-metal
firmware.


Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a DSLogic Plus (at 50MHz, with SPI clock at 16MHz):
