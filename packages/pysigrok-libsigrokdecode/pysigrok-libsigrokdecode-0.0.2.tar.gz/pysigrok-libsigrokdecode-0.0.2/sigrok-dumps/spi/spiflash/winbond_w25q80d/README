The logic analyzer used was a DreamSourceLab DSLogic Plus (at 10MHz):

  Probe       W25Q80DV pin
  ------------------------
  0           CS#
  1           CLK
  2           DI (MOSI)
  3           DO (MISO)


chip_erase_and_writes.sr
------------------------

Device ID and status query followed by chip erase, polling of the chip
status and then by few writes and verifying reads.


chip_erase_and_writes_{start,end}.sr
------------------------------------

Smaller snippets extracted from the file above, since it's very large.


ce_without_wren.sr
------------------

Test file for write enable warnings, issues chip erase without first having
