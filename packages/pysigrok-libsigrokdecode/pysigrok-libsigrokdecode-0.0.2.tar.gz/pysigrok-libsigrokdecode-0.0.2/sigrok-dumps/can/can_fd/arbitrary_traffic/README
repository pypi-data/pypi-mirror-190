These captures are artifically generated CAN-FD messages and are not capturing
specific vehicle or industrial protocols.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a Dreamsoucelab DSLogic Plus at a sample rate of
100MHz.

Channel 0 was hooked up to a PEAK-PCAN-USB Pro CAN-FD device which has two
CAN ports. Both ports were connected together using a selfmade circuit board.

The bus was externally terminated by adding a 120 Ohm resistor between CAN_L
and CAN_H.

The data has been generated using PEAK PCAN-View v4.2.1.533 software running
under Windows 7. Firmware on PCAN-USB Pro was v3.2.0. Driver version was 4.1.4.
Both ports were opened by running two instances of the software. One for each
port. All ACKs were handled by the participants.
