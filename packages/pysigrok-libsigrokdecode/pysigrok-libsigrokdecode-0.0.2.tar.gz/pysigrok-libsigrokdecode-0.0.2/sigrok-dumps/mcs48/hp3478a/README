Intel MCS-48 external memory access
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example dump of external program memory access on an Intel 8039 (like the 8048,
part of the MCS-48 family) in an HP 3478A bench multimeter.

The 8039 has no internal ROM. The respective mcs48 PD was designed to
reconstruct a ROM dump without needing to desolder the ROM IC.

The HP3478A is special in that it needed to access 8kB of code -- the normal
MCS-48 address space is 4kB, so an extra address line was added (A12) under
software control. In other words, they have crafted their code to toggle a
pin to control A12 and thus switch memory "banks".

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was an Saleae Logic16 clone (at 8MHz).

  Probe       i8039
  -----------------
  0           A8
  1           A9
  2           A10
  3           A11
  4           A12
  5           ALE
  7           PSEN
  8           D0
  9           D1
  10          D2
  11          D3
  12          D4
  13          D5
  14          D6
  15          D7

A sampling rate of 8MHz was sufficient to validate transitions on ALE and PSEN.


Data

Example sigrok-cli invocation to dump the memory accesses:

 $ sigrok-cli -i i8039_sample.sr -P mcs48:d0=D0:d1=D1:d2=D2:d3=D3:d4=D4:d5=D5:d6=D6:d7=D7:a8=A8:a9=A9:a10=A10:a11=A11:a12=A12:ale=ALE:psen=PSEN

The text annotations are formated as "XXXX:YY" where XXXX is the address
and YY the byte at that address.

A more useful command:

 $ sigrok-cli -i i8039_sample.sr -P mcs48:d0=D0:d1=D1:d2=D2:d3=D3:d4=D4:d5=D5:d6=D6:d7=D7:a8=A8:a9=A9:a10=A10:a11=A11:a12=A12:ale=ALE:psen=PSEN -B mcs48 > rom_access.bin

This writes every access to a raw file, simply as 3-byte chunks [XX XX YY]
which may easily be post-processed to reconstruct the full ROM image.
