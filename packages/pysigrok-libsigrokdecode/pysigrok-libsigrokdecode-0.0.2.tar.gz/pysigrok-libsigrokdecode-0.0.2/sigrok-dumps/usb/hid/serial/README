SiLabs CP2110 serial-over-HID, UT612 LCR meter
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a capture of UART-over-HID communication to a UNI-T UT612 LCR meter
which contains the SiLabs CP2110 HID chip and the ES51919 LCR meter chip.
UART communication uses 9600/8n1, USB HID runs at full speed (USB1.1 12MHz).

The LCR meter actually exclusively transmits data to the PC's RX line. The
PC's TX traffic is just a development hack in preparation of bidirectional
communication where cables support it.


Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The Asix Sigma analyzer was set to 50MHz samplerate. Capture length is 200M
samples, which translates to four seconds duration.
