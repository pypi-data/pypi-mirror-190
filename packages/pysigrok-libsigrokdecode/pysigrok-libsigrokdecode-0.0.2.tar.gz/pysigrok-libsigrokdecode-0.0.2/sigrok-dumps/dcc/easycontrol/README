DCC model train captures
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These captures contain data that was recorded on a model railway setup that
is based on the tams elektronik EasyControl controller. The booster used was
a self-built tams elektronik B-2 booster.


Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a Saleae Logic clone (samplerate 1MHz). The
signal was captured via a simple voltage clamping circuit.
