See the parent directory for more general information. These captures
correspond to the SLE4442 chip. Each file demonstrates an individual
operation.


Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a Cypress FX2 no-brand device (at 500kHz):

  Probe       SLE4442 pin
  -----------------------
  0           I/O
  1           CLK
  2           RST

sle4442_psc_correct.sr
----------------------

Reader reset, correct PSC (Programmable Security Code) sent by the reader to
the card, and gets accepted.


sle4442_psc_wrong.sr
--------------------

Reader reset, incorrect PSC sent by the reader to the card, and gets refused.


sle4442_read_main_memory.sr
---------------------------

Full read of the card's main memory (complete address range). Includes the
ATR content at offset 0.


sle4442_write_cafe1337_offset_30.sr
-----------------------------------

Write 0xCA 0xFE 0x13 0x37 to main memory at offset 0x30, then read back
several main memory regions (starting slightly before the recently written
address range, and starting from the beginning of the card's memory). Each
read continues to the end of the card's capacity.
