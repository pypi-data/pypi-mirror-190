Siemens SLE44xx Chip Card Protocol
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SLE 4418/4428/4432/4442 memory cards implement a 2-wire protocol for data
communication (signals CLK and I/O). A RST signal can be used to terminate
currently pending long memory reads, and resets the card's address counter
when combined with CLK. The next response data then is the Answer to Reset
(ATR) which identifies the chip's capabilities, and allows to adjust for
subsequent communication of more requests.
