This is a set of example captures of the Renesas/Hitachi AUD (Advanced User
Debugger) protocol.

  1           AUDCK
  2           nAUDSYNC
  3           AUDATA3
  4           AUDATA2
  5           AUDATA1
  6           AUDATA0

The audgen-* files are artificially generated thus:

 - audgen-01.v is written in Verilog; due to limitations in sigrok only
   single-bit values are output.
 - Icarus Verilog is run to create a VCD dump:
   - "iverilog audgen-01.v"
   - "./a.out" (created by iverilog)
 - The resulting VCD can probably be opened directly by PulseView, but is
    here converted to a .sr dump.

AUD traffic can be challenging to capture because it is clocked out at the
MCU's clock frequency (20MHz typical). This requires an LA capable of either:

 - Timing analysis on 6 channels (clock, sync, data3..0) at >= 80MSps
   (40MSps gives very inconsistent results)
 - State analysis @ 20MHz, this would be "easy" but cheap hardware like
   Logic/Logic16 can't do it.
