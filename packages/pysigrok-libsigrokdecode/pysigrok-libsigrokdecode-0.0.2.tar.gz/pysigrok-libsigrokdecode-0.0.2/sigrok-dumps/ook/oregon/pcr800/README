PCR800: OOK data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an example capture of an Oregon Scientific PCR800 rain sensor which
transmits at 433.92 MHz using Manchester encoding and amplitude modulation.

The signal was received by an RF Solutions RX12 superhet decoder chip and then
passed to the logic analyser.

In order to decode the Oregon v3 PCR800 you will need a preamble of '1111 ...'
(default) in the ook decoder. Currently you can ook decode either a preamble
of '1111 ...' or '1010 ...' but not both at the same time, so you can see
Oregon v2.1 or v1/3 sensors.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a USBee AX Pro / Saleae Logic clone (at 25kHz):

  Probe       RX12
  ----------------
  0           OUT
  1           Output from Arduino running virtual BTHR968


Data
----

 * oregon_pcr800.sr:
   Contains a single set of pulses that belong to an Oregon Scientific PCR800
   rain sensor. These should decode as channel 0, battery OK, rainfall 0
   in/hour, total 38.885 inches (since the battery was changed), checksum OK.
