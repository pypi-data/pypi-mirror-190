BTHR968: OOK data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an example capture of a virtual Oregon Scientific BTHR968 temperature,
humidity and pressure sensor which transmits at 433.92 MHz using Manchester
encoding and amplitude modulation.

The signal was received by an RF Solutions RX12 superhet decoder chip and then
passed to the logic analyser.

In order to decode the Oregon v2.1 BTHR968 you will need to change the
preamble to '1010 ...' in the ook decoder. Currently you can ook decode either
a preamble of '1111 ...' or '1010 ...' but not both at the same time, so you
can see Oregon v2.1 or v3 sensors.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a USBee AX Pro / Saleae Logic clone (at 25kHz):

  Probe       RX12
  ----------------
  0           OUT
  1           Output from Arduino running virtual BTHR968


Data
----

 * oregon_bthr968.sr:
   Contains a single set of pulses that belong to a virtual Oregon Scientific
   BTHR968 temperature, humidity and pressure sensor. These should decode as
   channel 2, battery OK, rollingcode BC, temp 11.2 deg C, humidity 52%,
   pressure 1013mb, checksum OK.
