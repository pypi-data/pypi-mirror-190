WGR800: OOK data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an example capture of an Oregon Scientific WGR800 wind sensor which
transmits at 433.92 MHz using Manchester encoding and amplitude modulation.

The signal was received by an RF Solutions RX12 superhet decoder chip and then
passed to the logic analyser.

In order to decode the Oregon v3 WGR800 you will need a preamble of '1111 ...'
(default) in the ook decoder. Currently you can ook decode either a preamble of
'1111 ...' or '1010 ...' but not both at the same time, so you can see Oregon
v2.1 or v1/3 sensors.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a USBee AX Pro / Saleae Logic clone (at 25kHz):

  Probe       RX12
  ----------------
  0           OUT
  1           Output from Arduino running virtual BTHR968


Data
----

 * oregon_wgr800.sr:
   Contains a single set of pulses that belong to an Oregon Scientific WGR800
   wind sensor. These should decode as channel 0, battery OK, rollingcode 5E,
   direction NE(45deg), gust 3.3m/s, speed 2m/s, checksum OK.
