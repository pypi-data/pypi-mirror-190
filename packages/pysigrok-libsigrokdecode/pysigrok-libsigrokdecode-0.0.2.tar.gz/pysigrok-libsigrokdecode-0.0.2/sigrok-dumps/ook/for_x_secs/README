FOR X SECS: OOK data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

for_x_secs contains longer captures which can contain multiple signals of
interest.


Notes for oregon_12s.sr
-----------------------

This is a 12 second capture of 433 MHz amplitude modulated data. It contains
traces for an Oregon Scientific THGN800 temperature and humidity sensor, a
PCR800 rain sensor, a WGR800 wind sensor and a virtual BTHR968 temperature
humidity and pressure sensor. There may also be some other signals in there
too.

In order to decode the Oregon v2.1 BTHR968 you will need to change the
preamble to '1010 ...' in the ook decoder. Currently you can ook decode either
a preamble of '1111 ...' or '1010 ...' but not both at the same time, so you
can see Oregon v2.1 or v1/3 sensors.

The signal was received by an RF Solutions RX12 superhet decoder chip and then
passed to the logic analyser.

The individual traces are also in separate files under the oregon folder.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a USBee AX Pro / Saleae Logic clone (at 25kHz):

Data
----

 * oregon_12s.sr:
   Contains a set of pulses that include Oregon Scientific PCR800, THGN800,
   WGR800 and BTHR968 sensors.

 * one_transition_10s.sr:
   Contains a single transition around 1 sec that is a useful template for
   using the ook_gen decoder.
