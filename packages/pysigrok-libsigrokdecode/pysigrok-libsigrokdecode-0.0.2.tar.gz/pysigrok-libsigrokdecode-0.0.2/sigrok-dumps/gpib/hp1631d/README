Data
----

The following is happening on the GPIB bus in this capture:

 - Controller sets the GPIB to UNLISTEN and UNTALK (neutral state)
 - Controller sets device with GPIB address number 4 to LISTEN
 - Controller sends command 'ID LF+EOI' to device with GPIB address number
   4 (request identity string)
 - Controller sets the GPIB to UNLISTEN and UNTALK (neutral state)
 - Controller sets device with GPIB address number 4 to TALK
 - Device with GPIB address number 4 sends the ID string 'HP1631D+EOI' to
   controller
 - Controller sets the GPIB to UNLISTEN and UNTALK (neutral state)
