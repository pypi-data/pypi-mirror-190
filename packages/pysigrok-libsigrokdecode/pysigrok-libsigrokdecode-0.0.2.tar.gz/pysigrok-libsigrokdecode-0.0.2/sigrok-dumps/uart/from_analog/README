uart_analog_10700_8n2.sr:

This was captured from an ATMega328p running at 1Mz from the internal
oscillator, with a DDR0 of 5.

The device used to capture this was a Hantek 6022BE, with an 8MHz sample rate,
single channel.

The ATMega was programmed to output bytes between 0x1A and 0x20, separated by
null bytes.
