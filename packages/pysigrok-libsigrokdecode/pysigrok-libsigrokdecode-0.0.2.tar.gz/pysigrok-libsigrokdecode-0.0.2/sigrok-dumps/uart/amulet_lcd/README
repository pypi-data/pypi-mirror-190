Amulet Technologies LCD UART protocol
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a dump of Amulet LCD UART protocol for Barco Encore Small Controller
video mixer controller.

Amulet LCDs have their own processor, flash and RAM. They work by displaying
pages created with GemStudio and have an "ASCII" protocol for selecting the
page and updating strings and other variables for widgets.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a DreamSourceLabs DSLogic (at 10MHz):

It was connected on the 5V logic level UART line between the Amulet
display and the main CPU board.

  Probe       UART
  ----------------
  0           RX (on the Amulet display)
  1           TX (on the Amulet display)


Data
----

The communication is UART (115200/8n1).

bootup.sr contains the display initialization at controller bootup, since all
of the pages are on the display flash no proprietary firmware is present.

menu_changes.sr is a capture of cycling between different menu pages using
buttons on the controller keyboard.
