USB Power Delivery protocol
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains captures of data communication on the Configuration
Channels of Type-C USB connectors using the USB Power Delivery protocol.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

These captures were made using different prototypes of the 'usb-c-grok', which
is an FX2 based device designed to capture USB Configuration Channel traffic.

I made all captures with PulseView, with the samplerate set to 4 MHz, except
when noted otherwise.


Devices used
------------

ZY12PDS Power Delivery sink module
 - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/ZY12PD/32810557770.html
 - Can be configured for 5/9/12/15/20V, or "highest possible" or
   "all in sequence"
 - Set to 9V, because I used it to upgrade a 9.6V toy car

zy12pds_sink_module-65w_noname_supply.sr
----------------------------------------

This supply lies. It says 65W on the box and device but advertises only 60W.
The sink is a module available from aliexpress or ebay which I configured to
request 9V.


zy12pds_sink_module-anker_powerbank.sr
--------------------------------------

The same module as before, now connected to the Anker powerbank, and configured
to request all the voltages sequentially, with 1800ms between each one. This
was captured at 6 MHz because at 4 MHz it had some issues with decoding packets
from the ZY12PDS module, but only at some voltages.
