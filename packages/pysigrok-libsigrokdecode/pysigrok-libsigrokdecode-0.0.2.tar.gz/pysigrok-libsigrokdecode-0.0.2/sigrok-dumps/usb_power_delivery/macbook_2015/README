Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

A 'Twinkie' USB type-C interposer was used to capture the communication
on the CCx pins:

  Probe      Signal
  -----------------
  CC1        Control Channel 1
  CC2        Control Channel 2

The type-C connectors are reversible, so the actual communication might
happen on CC1 or CC2 depending the polarity of the plug inside the receptacle.


Data
----

Captured between an Apple Macbook 2015 (with a USB type-C connector) and both
its 5V/14.8V power supply and an Apple USB-C to HDMI AV accessory.

The sigrok command lines used were:

  sigrok-cli -d chromium-twinkie --continuous -o apple_power_brick.sr
  sigrok-cli -d chromium-twinkie --continuous -o apple_av_hdmi.sr
