NEC infrared protocol
------------------------------------------------------------------------

These captures were taken with the "Joy-IT SBC IR01" remote control. File
joy_it_sbc_irc01_all.sr contains data for all the buttons of that remote.
File joy_it_sbc_irc01_enter_no_repeat.sr contains a single button that gets
pressed repeatedly, but for a short period of time such that the remote
won't send a repeat signal (each button press is new).

There are several interesting aspects to these files:
- The signal would not decode with 5% tolerance. A wider limit is needed
  because this remote control's signal is outside of that narrow window.
- The absence of IR frames for repeated button press could reveal an issue
  with earlier decoder implementations, where the emission of annotations
  for an IR frame was deferred until the start of the next IR frame.
