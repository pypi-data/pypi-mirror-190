Philips RC-6 remote control captures
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These captures contain the IR data sent by various remote controls.


Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a Saleae Logic (at 1MHz):

  Probe       RC-6
  ----------------
  0           IR
  1           Raw

The data was captured using a TSOP1736 directly connected to channel 0.
For comparison a phototransistor is connected to channel 1. Only channel 0
should be used for decoding.


kathrein_RC674_numbers.sr
-------------------------

This capture was taken with a Kathrein RC(U)674 remote control. The
sequence of keys is "power", 1, 2, ..., 9, 0.

Note that this remote uses Mode 6B and does not make use of the 
integrated toggle bit, but uses the first data bit for that purpose.
