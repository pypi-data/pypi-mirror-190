Philips RC-6 remote control captures
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These captures contain the IR data sent by various remote controls.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a Saleae Logic (at 1MHz):

  Probe       RC-6
  ----------------
  0           IR
  1           Raw

The data was captured using a TSOP1736 directly connected to channel 0.
For comparison a phototransistor is connected to channel 1. Only channel 0
should be used for decoding.
