SD card / SD mode / R-Car H2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a set of example captures of SD cards in "SD mode" (not SPI mode).

The cards were used in a board called "Lager" powered by a Renesas R-Car H2
(r8a7790) SoC. The SD card was a Samsung PRO 32GB microSDHC.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a OpenBench Logic Sniffer at 50MHz.

For easier measurement, the Linux driver for the SD controller was forced
at 1 bit bus width and 25MHz max frequency.

Obtained via PulseView, so no command-line.
