This set of example captures demonstrates CMD24 (write single block)
commands including their data phase.

Pierre Poulain provided these files in bug #1365 as public domain.

Data
----

File data_transfer_start_snippet.sr was recorded in a live setup, and
contains the start of a write command -- but does not complete it which
is why the decoder won't annotate the operation.

File data_transfer_complete_simulated.sr contains a complete CMD24 start
as well as the communication of the R1 response, the data start token,
the payload data, and the data response. This capture was created by a
simulation.

File data_transfer_complete_real.sr is similar to the above, but is a
capture of a "real" transfer. The data (512 bytes) is all-zero, except for
the first 12 bytes which are ASCII "Sigrok rocks".
