Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was an mcupro Saleae 16 clone (at 2 MHz).

-------------------------

This is the I2C communication of the FX2_MEM EEPROM being flashed with
8051 firmware and then verified on a Glasgow board. Only the changed bytes are
written, which is why there are two read sequences. The uneven pages are
because of the EP0 buffer being limited to 64 bytes.
