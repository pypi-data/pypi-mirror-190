This is traffic captured off an internal I2C bus of a Tektronix TDS 744A
oscilloscope.

On this bus there are two X24C02 EEPROMs, mapped at addresses 0 and 1.

The I2C decoder will show the shifted addresses as 0x50 and 0x51 respectively.

The decoded traffic consists of some initial reads, some (failed) probes of an
inexistant device at address 0x52, then two block reads of 248 and 192 bytes.
