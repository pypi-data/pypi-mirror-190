-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These captures are examples of various transaction types from an IBM POWER9 LPC
(low pin count) interface.

Hardware setup
--------------

The logic analyser used was a DreamSourceLab DSLogic U3Pro32. As support for
this is not yet in sigrok, the traces were captured externally and imported.
