Maplin L95AR: Remote control mains sockets data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a set of example captures of the remote control data on a Maplin L95AR
13A remote control mains sockets 4 pack. The remote transmits at 433.92 MHz
and uses amplitude modulation.

The signal is received by an RF Solutions RR3 decoder chip and then passed
to the logic analyser.

The RR3 decoder has been superceded by newer models.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a USBee AX Pro / Saleae Logic clone (at 100kHz):

  Probe       RR3

Data
----

 * maplin_l95ar_single_a.sr:
   Contains a single set of pulses from pressing button A.

 * maplin_l95ar_three_a.sr:
   Contains a three sets of pulses from pressing button A.

 * maplin_l95ar_a_b_c_d_on.sr:
   Shows the received signal from pressing button A then button B
   then button C and then button D.

Note that there are some signals that are broken at the end of each button
press. Both my remotes seem to do this.
