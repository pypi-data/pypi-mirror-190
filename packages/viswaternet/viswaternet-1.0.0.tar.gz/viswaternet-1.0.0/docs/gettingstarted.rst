Getting Started 
=======

To get started, import both viswaternet and matplotlib.pyplot:

.. code:: python

    import viswaternet as vis
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Next, initialize a matplotlib figure and viswaternet model. For example purposes we use the CTown network included in the Examples folder:

.. code:: python

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 12))
    model = vis.VisWNModel('Networks/CTown.inp')
    
Finally, call on any of the plotting functions with the argument inputs of your choice. For example, the following line of code generates a discrete plot for maximum nodal pressure in units of psi:

.. code:: python

    model.plot_discrete_nodes(ax, parameter="pressure", value='max', unit="psi")

A range of examples to understand the different VisWaterNet plotting functions can be found in the `Example Applications`_ section in the documentation and in the the `Examples`_ folder.
