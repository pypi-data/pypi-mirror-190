osm2gmns is an open-source Python package that enables users to conveniently obtain and 
manipulate any networks from OpenStreetMap (OSM). With a single line of Python code, 
users can obtain and model drivable, bikeable, walkable, railway, and aeroway networks 
for any region in the world and output networks to CSV files in GMNS format for seamless 
data sharing and research collaboration. osm2gmns mainly focuses on providing researchers and 
practitioners with flexible, standard and ready-to-use multi-modal transportation networks, 
as well as a bunch of customized and practical functions to facilitate various research 
and applications on traffic modeling.

Main Features
====================================

- Obtain any networks from OSM. osm2gmns parses map data from OSM and output networks to 
  csv files in GMNS format.
- Standard network format. osm2gmns adopts GMNS as the network format for seamless data 
  sharing and research collaboration.
- Ready-to-use network. osm2gmns cleans erroneous information from osm map data and is able 
  to fill up critical missing values, i.e., lanes, speed and capacity, to quickly provide 
  ready-to-use networks.
- Directed network. two directed road links are generated for each bi-directional osm ways identified by osm2gmns
- Multi-module support. five different network types are supported, including auto, bike, walk, railway, and aeroway
- Customized and practical functions to facilitate traffic modeling. functions include 
  complex intersection consolidation, moevement generation, traffic zone creation, short link combination, 
  network visualization.
- Multi-Resolution modeling. osm2gmns automatically construct the corresponding mesoscopic and microscopic
  networks for any macroscopic network in GMNS format.
