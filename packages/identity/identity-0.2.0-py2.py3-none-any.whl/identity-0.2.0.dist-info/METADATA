  and Personal Microsoft accounts such as Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com).
* Currently designed for web apps,
  regardless of which Python web framework you are using.
* Provides a set of high level API that is built on top of, and easier to be used than
  [Microsoft's MSAL Python library](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python).
* Written in Python, for Python apps.
