About
-----

This is a Python port of the SED fitter from [Robitaille et al., 2007, ApJS 169
328](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJS..169..328R). It replaces the
original Fortran code which can be found
[here](https://github.com/astrofrog/sedfitter-legacy).

At this stage, it should be used cautiously as it is still beta-quality
software and may contain bugs. Please make sure that you verify your results
using an independent method if at all possible.

The documentation is available at http://sedfitter.readthedocs.org
