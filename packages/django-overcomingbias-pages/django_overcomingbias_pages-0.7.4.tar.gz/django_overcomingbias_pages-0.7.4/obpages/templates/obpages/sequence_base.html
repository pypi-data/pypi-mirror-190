        <p>A sequence is an ordered collection of related content.</p>
        <p>Try using them for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reading lists: keep track of what you have read (or watched, or heard)</li>
            <li>Favourites: keep track of what you found interesting / useful</li>
            <li>Compilations: collect and publish the best content on some topic</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have created a sequence, you can export it to epub, pdf or markdown formats (more formats available on request!).</p>
        <p>If you think your sequence is good enough for this page, leave some <a href={% url "feedback" %}>feedback</a> and I may curate it.</p>
